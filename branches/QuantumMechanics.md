# Quantum Mechanics

This section will not only be introducing basic concepts and theories in research achievements in quantum mechanics, but also be sharing resources or refrences for those who are willing to further their study in this field. Although physicists have paved a way on the barren land of quantum mechanics, its future remains uncertain. If my insignificant efforts can help the brave who will break through the fog at the end of the road in the future, it would be my greatest honor.
