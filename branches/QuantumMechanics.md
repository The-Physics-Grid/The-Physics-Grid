# Quantum Mechanics

This section will not only be introducing basic concepts and theories in research achievements in quantum mechanics, but also be sharing resources or refrences for those who are willing to further their study in this field. Although physicists have paved a way on the barren land of quantum mechanics, its future remains uncertain. If my insignificant efforts can help the brave who will break through the fog at the end of the road in the future, it would be my greatest honor.

Quantum mechanics is a sub-discipline of physics. It describes the behavior of nature at and below the atomic scale. It is the foundation of all quantum physics, including quantum chemistry, quantum field theory, quantum technology, and quantum information science.

Quantum mechanics, along with the theory of relativity, are considered the two fundamental pillars of modern physics. At the end of the 19th century, it was discovered that the old classical theories could not explain microscopic systems, so through the efforts of physicists, quantum mechanics was created in the early 20th century to explain these phenomena. Quantum mechanics has fundamentally changed our understanding of the structure of matter and its interactions. With the exception of gravity, which is described by the general theory of relativity, all fundamental interactions to date can be described within the framework of quantum mechanics (quantum field theory).
