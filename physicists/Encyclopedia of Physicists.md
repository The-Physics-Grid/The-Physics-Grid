### **Albert Einstein**

Albert Einstein (March 14, 1879 – April 18, 1955), a Jewish theoretical physicist born in Germany with Switzerland and United States nationality, founded the theory of relativity, which is considered one of the two pillars of modern physics, and also made outstanding achievements in the field of quantum mechanics. He is the discoverer of the mass-energy equivalence formula (E = mc²). He was also influential in the field of philosophy of science. He was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921 for his "contributions to theoretical physics, in particular the discovery of the principle of the photoelectric effect". This discovery is a crucial step in the establishment of quantum theory.

Albert Einstein discovered early in his career that classical mechanics and electromagnetic fields could not coexist with each other, leading to the development of the special theory of relativity. He also discovered that the principles of relativity could be extended to the modeling of gravitational fields. Based on some theories of gravity, he published the general theory of relativity in 1915. His continued research on statistical mechanics and quantum theory led him to derive explanations for particle theory and molecular motion. In 1917, Albert Einstein applied the theory of general relativity to model the large-scale structure of the universe.

When Adolf · Hitler came to power as chancellor of Germany in 1933, Einstein was visiting the United States. Since Einstein was Jewish, he did not return to Germany despite being a professor at the Prussian Academy of Sciences. In 1940, he settled in United States and subsequently became a United States citizen. On the eve of World War II, he signed a letter to then United States President Franklin · Roosevelt, in which he suggested that Germany might develop a new and powerful bomb, and suggested that United States should also conduct research on it as soon as possible, United States the Manhattan Project began. Einstein supported the strengthening of the Allies' armed forces, but condemned the idea of using the then-newly discovered nuclear fission for weapons purposes, and Einstein later signed the Russell-Einstein Declaration with the United Kingdom philosopher Bertrand · Russell, emphasizing the dangers of nuclear weapons.

Albert Einstein was one of the most important scientists of the 20th century, publishing more than 300 scientific papers and 150 non-scientific works in his lifetime, and is known as the "father of modern physics". His scientific achievements of excellence and originality have made the term "Einstein" synonymous with "genius".

### **Isaac Newton**

Sir Isaac Newton (Julian calendar: December 25, 1642 – March 20, 1727; Gregorian calendar: January 4, 1643 – March 31, 1727) was a United Kingdom physicist, mathematician, astronomer, natural philosopher, and Whig politician. In 1687 he published *The Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy*, which expounded gravitation and the three laws of motion, thus laying the foundations of modern physics, astronomy, and modern engineering. By demonstrating the consistency between Kepler's laws of planetary motion and his theory of gravity, he revealed that the motion of terrestrial objects and celestial bodies follows the same laws of nature; It provides strong theoretical support for the heliocentric theory and is a major representative of the scientific revolution.

In mechanics, Newton elucidated the principle of conservation of momentum and angular momentum. Optically, he invented the reflecting telescope and developed a theory of color based on the observation that a prism diverges white light into the visible spectrum. He also systematically formulated the law of cooling and studied the speed of sound.

In mathematics, Newton shared the honor of developing calculus with Gottfried · Leibniz. He also proved the generalized binomial theorem, proposed the "Newtonian method" to approximate the zero point of a function, and contributed to the study of power series.

In 2005, the Royal Society of United Kingdom launched a poll on "Who is the most influential person in the history of science", and Newton won the crown in the voting of the Royal Society Fellows and netizens.

### **Max Planck**

Max Karl Ernst Ludwig Planck (April 23, 1858 – October 4, 1947) was a Germany physicist and one of the founders of quantum mechanics. He was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1918 (awarded in 1919) for his discovery of energy quanta. The Planck constant, which bears his name, was used in 2019 to redefine the basic unit. In addition, there are many scientific trophies, institutions and societies that bear his name.

It was around 1894 that Planck began to devote all his energies to the study of blackbody radiation. Shortly thereafter, on December 14, 1900, Planck came up with a theoretical corollary of the radiation law, in which he used the statistical mechanics of the Austrian physicist Ludwig · Boltzmann, whom he had previously denied. Planck proposed the hypothesis of energy quantization at the conference: E=hv, where E is energy, ν is the frequency, and an important physical constant, h, is introduced, the Planck constant, and energy can only be radiated outward in the form of an indivisible energy element (i.e., quanta). Such a hypothesis reconciles the contradictions encountered in the study of the law of thermal radiation in classical physics. Based on this assumption, he also gave Planck's formula for black-body radiation, which satisfactorily explained the experimental phenomenon. Planck was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1918. Although Planck tried to bring his theories within the framework of classical physics in later years, he is still regarded as one of the pioneers of modern physics.

Planck rejected the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics proposed by Bohr, Werner· Heisenberg, and Pauli at the end of the 20th century, as opposed to Schrödinger and Max· von · Laue, and Einstein became a conservative at this time. Planck considered Heisenberg's matrix mechanics "disgusting" and looked to the Schrödinger equation as a savior. Planck felt that wave dynamics would soon make his own quantum theory redundant, but scientific truths continued to be revealed despite his ideas.

### **Robert Hooke**

Robert Hooke (July 18, 1635 – March 3, 1703) was a UK polymath known for his contributions to physics, proposing Hooke's law and the inverse square law of gravity. He designed vacuum pumps, microscopes, and telescopes, and authored *Micrographic*, coining the term "cell". His inventions are still in use today. Hooke also impacted urban planning and architecture. Despite conflicts with Newton, his work is now receiving renewed attention, earning him the nickname "Leonardo of London" for his diverse interests and achievements.

In 1664, Hooke created an advanced microscope inspired by a Royal Society member. In 1665, he examined a thin cork slice under his own microscope, observing plant cells' resemblance to monks' single rooms, thus coining "cell". He published *Micrographic*, detailing his microscopic and telescopic observations, marking the first human observation of cells.

In 1663, Gregory designed but couldn't build the Gregorian telescope. Hooke later built the first reflecting telescope, using it to observe Mars' rotation, Jupiter's Great Red Spot, lunar craters, and binary stars. In 1676, after studying metal elasticity, he published the anagram "ceiiinosssttuv," which later became "ut tensio sic vis," revealing Hooke's law: force is proportional to elongation.

### **Werner Heisenberg**

Werner Carl Heisenberg (December 5, 1901 – February 1, 1976) was a Germany physicist, one of the founders of quantum mechanics, and a representative figure of the "Copenhagen School". In 1933, Heisenberg was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1932 for "the founding of quantum mechanics and the resulting discovery of allotropes of hydrogen." His main contributions to physics are the matrix form of quantum mechanics (matrix mechanics), the "uncertainty principle" (also known as the "Heisenberg uncertainty principle") and the S-matrix theory. His Principles of Physics in Quantum Theory is a classic work in the field of quantum mechanics.

Heisenberg is renowned for his quantum mechanics theory, introduced at age 23 and earning him the 1932 Nobel Prize in Physics (received in 1933) for its applications, including the discovery of hydrogen spin isomers. His theory, grounded in atomic radiation observations, posits the impossibility of pinpointing an electron's position or tracing its path, thus negating Bohr's electron orbitals. Physical quantities like position and velocity are not represented by conventional numbers but by matrices, marking the birth of matrix mechanics.

Heisenberg also formulated the "uncertainty principle," stating that in quantum systems, a particle's position and momentum cannot be precisely known simultaneously, with position uncertainty Δx and momentum uncertainty Δp having a product no less than h/4π, where h is Planck's constant. This principle, though negligible on a human scale, is crucial in atomic studies.

Starting in 1953, Heisenberg focused on the unified field theory of elementary particles, essential for advancing particle physics understanding. From 1957, his focus shifted to plasma physics and high-temperature nuclear reactions.

Heisenberg was a participant in Germany's nuclear weapons development program, but Nazi Germany was never capable of moving nuclear weapons from theory to reality. Heisenberg himself offered one account that he did not trust the Hitler regime and was therefore trying to delay the research program in Nazi Germany. But some people, such as Goodschmidt, scoffed at this claim, which has been dubbed the "Heisenberg Mystery."
