### **Charles-Augustin de Coulomb**

![Charles-Augustin de Coulomb](/images/Coulomb.jpg)


Charles-Augustin de Coulomb (1736-1806) was a French physicist, military engineer, and founder of soil mechanics. Coulomb is best known for his summary and study of the interaction between electric charges, which led to Coulomb's law, which has become a basic law of physics teaching in middle schools around the world. In addition, Coulomb also made in-depth research on friction. In order to commemorate Coulomb, his name was used to name the unit of electric charge in the International System of Units in 1908.

In physics, there is an interaction between different electric charges, with like charges repelling each other and opposite charges attracting each other, but people did not know what the law of this interaction was at that time. Coulomb was very interested in this problem, and he used his knowledge of mechanics to study it. Coulomb first studied the attraction and repulsion of magnets. He divided magnets into two types of magnetic cores, and then guessed that the force between them was inversely proportional to the size of the magnetic core and the square of the distance based on the law of universal gravitation.

The famous British scientist Cavendish once designed a torsion balance that could measure the magnitude of universal gravitation. Coulomb made his own torsion balance in imitation of Cavendish, and used the torsion balance to measure the magnitude of the force, proving the conclusion of the interaction between magnetic cores, which is called Coulomb's magnetic law. In addition, Coulomb also proposed a method to eliminate the friction of the compass. He used hair and silk to hang the compass to reduce friction.

### **Albert Einstein**

![Albert Einstein](/images/Einstein.jpg)

Albert Einstein (March 14, 1879 – April 18, 1955), a Jewish theoretical physicist born in Germany with Switzerland and United States nationality, founded the theory of relativity, which is considered one of the two pillars of modern physics, and also made outstanding achievements in the field of quantum mechanics. He is the discoverer of the mass-energy equivalence formula (E = mc²). He was also influential in the field of philosophy of science. He was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921 for his "contributions to theoretical physics, in particular the discovery of the principle of the photoelectric effect". This discovery is a crucial step in the establishment of quantum theory.

Albert Einstein discovered early in his career that classical mechanics and electromagnetic fields could not coexist with each other, leading to the development of the special theory of relativity. He also discovered that the principles of relativity could be extended to the modeling of gravitational fields. Based on some theories of gravity, he published the general theory of relativity in 1915. His continued research on statistical mechanics and quantum theory led him to derive explanations for particle theory and molecular motion. In 1917, Albert Einstein applied the theory of general relativity to model the large-scale structure of the universe.

When Adolf · Hitler came to power as chancellor of Germany in 1933, Einstein was visiting the United States. Since Einstein was Jewish, he did not return to Germany despite being a professor at the Prussian Academy of Sciences. In 1940, he settled in United States and subsequently became a United States citizen. On the eve of World War II, he signed a letter to then United States President Franklin · Roosevelt, in which he suggested that Germany might develop a new and powerful bomb, and suggested that United States should also conduct research on it as soon as possible, United States the Manhattan Project began. Einstein supported the strengthening of the Allies' armed forces, but condemned the idea of using the then-newly discovered nuclear fission for weapons purposes, and Einstein later signed the Russell-Einstein Declaration with the United Kingdom philosopher Bertrand · Russell, emphasizing the dangers of nuclear weapons.

Albert Einstein was one of the most important scientists of the 20th century, publishing more than 300 scientific papers and 150 non-scientific works in his lifetime, and is known as the "father of modern physics". His scientific achievements of excellence and originality have made the term "Einstein" synonymous with "genius".

### **Michael Faraday**

![Michael Faraday](/images/Michael%20Faraday.jpg)

Michael Faraday (September 22, 1791 – August 25, 1867) was United Kingdom physicist who made many important contributions to the fields of electromagnetism and electrochemistry.

Faraday studied the magnetic field around the current-carrying wire in detail and came up with the idea of the magnetic field line, thus establishing the concept of electromagnetic field. Faraday observed that the magnetic field affects the propagation of light and figured out the relationship between the two. He also discovered the principle of electromagnetic induction, diamagnetism, Faraday's law of electrolysis. As a result of Faraday's efforts, electromagnetic phenomena began to emerge from scientific and technological developments with practical uses.

Faraday was also a chemist, discovering benzene, studying chlorine cage compounds, inventing the early form of Bunsen burner and oxidation number, and popularizing the terms anode, cathode, electrode, and ion.

Although Faraday was an excellent experimenter, able to convey ideas in clear and simple language, his mathematical ability was relatively weak, and he was limited to knowing how to use the simplest algebra, and was not familiar with other higher-order mathematics such as trigonometry. Therefore, James · Maxwell, who synthesized the research of Faraday and other scholars, wrote Maxwell's equation, which became the cornerstone of modern electromagnetic theory. In honor of Faraday, in the International System of Units, the unit of capacitance is the Faraday.

### **Richard Feynman**

![Richard Feynman](/images/RichardFeynman.jpg)

Richard Phillips Feynman (May 11, 1918 - February 15, 1988) was an American theoretical physicist, known for his research on the path integral representation of quantum mechanics, quantum electrodynamics, superfluidity of supercooled liquid helium, and parton models in particle physics. For his contributions to quantum electrodynamics, Feynman shared the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1965 with Julian Schwinger and Shin'ichirō Tomonaga.

Feynman developed the widely used graphical mathematical representation of the behavior of subatomic particles, the Feynman diagram. During his lifetime, Feynman was one of the most famous scientists in the world. In 1999, in a poll conducted by the British academic journal Physical World involving 130 of the world's top physicists, Feynman was ranked among the top ten greatest physicists of all time.

Feynman helped develop the atomic bomb during World War II, and then became well-known to the public in the 1980s for his involvement in the investigation of the Challenger space shuttle disaster. In addition to his research in theoretical physics, he was also a pioneer in quantum computing and proposed the concept of nanotechnology. He was formerly the Richard Tolman Professor of Theoretical Physics at Caltech.

### **Stephen Hawking**

![Stephen Hawking](/images/Stephen%20Hawking.jpg)

Stephen · William ·Hawking (8 January 1942 – 14 March 2018) was United Kingdom theoretical physicist, cosmologist and popular science writer, and was the research director of the Centre for Theoretical Cosmology at the University of Cambridge. He has made many scientific contributions, including co-authoring the Penrose-Hawking singularity theorem within the framework of general relativity with Roger · Penrose, and his theoretical prediction that black holes emit radiation (now known as Hawking radiation). Stephen Hawking was the first to propose a theory of cosmology explained by the combination of general relativity and quantum mechanics. He is an active proponent of the many-world interpretation of quantum mechanics.

Stephen Hawking is a recipient of the Royal Society for Literature and Art Prize (FRSA), a life member of the Pontifical Academy of Sciences, and a former recipient of the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the highest civilian award awarded by the United States. In 2002, Hawking was ranked 25th in the BBC's "100 Greatest United Kingdom" poll. From 1979 to 2009, Hawking was the Lucas Professor of Mathematics at the University of Cambridge. Stephen Hawking has written a number of popular science books expounding his theories and general cosmology, which have been widely acclaimed. His book, A Brief History of Time: From the Big Bang to Black Holes, topped the Sunday Times bestseller list in United Kingdom for a total of 237 weeks.

Hawking suffers from a rare early-onset, slow-progressing motor neuron disease (also known as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis) that progressively worsens over time. In his later years, he was paralyzed and unable to speak, and had to rely on speech-generating devices to communicate with others. Initially the device was used by a hand-held switch, but eventually by using a unilateral cheek muscle.

On March 14, 2018, Hawking's family issued a statement saying that Hawking died at the age of 76. The burial of his ashes took place on 15 June 2018 in the chapel of the nave of Westminster Abbey in London.

### **Werner Heisenberg**

![Werner Heisenberg](/images/Werner%20Heisenberg.jpg)

Werner Carl Heisenberg (December 5, 1901 – February 1, 1976) was a Germany physicist, one of the founders of quantum mechanics, and a representative figure of the "Copenhagen School". In 1933, Heisenberg was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1932 for "the founding of quantum mechanics and the resulting discovery of allotropes of hydrogen." His main contributions to physics are the matrix form of quantum mechanics (matrix mechanics), the "uncertainty principle" (also known as the "Heisenberg uncertainty principle") and the S-matrix theory. His Principles of Physics in Quantum Theory is a classic work in the field of quantum mechanics.

Heisenberg is renowned for his quantum mechanics theory, introduced at age 23 and earning him the 1932 Nobel Prize in Physics (received in 1933) for its applications, including the discovery of hydrogen spin isomers. His theory, grounded in atomic radiation observations, posits the impossibility of pinpointing an electron's position or tracing its path, thus negating Bohr's electron orbitals. Physical quantities like position and velocity are not represented by conventional numbers but by matrices, marking the birth of matrix mechanics.

Heisenberg also formulated the "uncertainty principle," stating that in quantum systems, a particle's position and momentum cannot be precisely known simultaneously, with position uncertainty Δx and momentum uncertainty Δp having a product no less than h/4π, where h is Planck's constant. This principle, though negligible on a human scale, is crucial in atomic studies.

Starting in 1953, Heisenberg focused on the unified field theory of elementary particles, essential for advancing particle physics understanding. From 1957, his focus shifted to plasma physics and high-temperature nuclear reactions.

Heisenberg was a participant in Germany's nuclear weapons development program, but Nazi Germany was never capable of moving nuclear weapons from theory to reality. Heisenberg himself offered one account that he did not trust the Hitler regime and was therefore trying to delay the research program in Nazi Germany. But some people, such as Goodschmidt, scoffed at this claim, which has been dubbed the "Heisenberg Mystery."

### **Robert Hooke**

![Robert Hooke](/images/Robert%20Hooke.jpg)

Robert Hooke (July 18, 1635 – March 3, 1703) was a UK polymath known for his contributions to physics, proposing Hooke's law and the inverse square law of gravity. He designed vacuum pumps, microscopes, and telescopes, and authored *Micrographic*, coining the term "cell". His inventions are still in use today. Hooke also impacted urban planning and architecture. Despite conflicts with Newton, his work is now receiving renewed attention, earning him the nickname "Leonardo of London" for his diverse interests and achievements.

In 1664, Hooke created an advanced microscope inspired by a Royal Society member. In 1665, he examined a thin cork slice under his own microscope, observing plant cells' resemblance to monks' single rooms, thus coining "cell". He published *Micrographic*, detailing his microscopic and telescopic observations, marking the first human observation of cells.

In 1663, Gregory designed but couldn't build the Gregorian telescope. Hooke later built the first reflecting telescope, using it to observe Mars' rotation, Jupiter's Great Red Spot, lunar craters, and binary stars. In 1676, after studying metal elasticity, he published the anagram "ceiiinosssttuv," which later became "ut tensio sic vis," revealing Hooke's law: force is proportional to elongation.

### **Joseph-Louis Lagrange**

![Joseph-Louis Lagrange](/images/Joseph-Louis%20Lagrange.jpg)

Joseph-Louis Lagrange (French: Joseph-Louis Lagrange, January 25, 1736 - April 10, 1813), born Giuseppe Luigi Lagrangia (Italian: Giuseppe Luigi Lagrangia) or Giuseppe Ludovico De la Grange Tournier (Italian: Giuseppe Ludovico De la Grange Tournier), was a French-Italian mathematician, mechanician and astronomer. Lagrange worked for Frederick the Great of Prussia in Berlin for 20 years and was called "the greatest mathematician in Europe" by Frederick the Great. Later, he was invited by King Louis XVI of France to settle in Paris until his death. Lagrange was talented throughout his life and made many significant contributions in the fields of mathematics, physics and astronomy. His achievements include the famous Lagrange mean value theorem, the creation of Lagrangian mechanics, etc.

Lagrangian mechanics is a type of analytical mechanics, founded by Joseph Lagrange in 1788. Lagrangian mechanics is a new theoretical expression of classical mechanics, focusing on mathematical analysis methods and applying the principle of least action. It is an important part of analytical mechanics.

The original expression of classical mechanics was established by Newton. It focuses on analyzing the relationship between vectors such as displacement, velocity, acceleration, and force, and is also called vector mechanics. Lagrange introduced the concept of generalized coordinates and used D'Alembert's principle to obtain the Lagrangian equation equivalent to Newton's second law. Not only that, the Lagrangian equation has a more general meaning and a wider range of application. In addition, choosing appropriate generalized coordinates can greatly simplify the solution process of the Lagrangian equation.

### **Isaac Newton**

![Isaac Newton](/images/Isaac%20Newton.jpg)

Sir Isaac Newton (Julian calendar: December 25, 1642 – March 20, 1727; Gregorian calendar: January 4, 1643 – March 31, 1727) was a United Kingdom physicist, mathematician, astronomer, natural philosopher, and Whig politician. In 1687 he published *The Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy*, which expounded gravitation and the three laws of motion, thus laying the foundations of modern physics, astronomy, and modern engineering. By demonstrating the consistency between Kepler's laws of planetary motion and his theory of gravity, he revealed that the motion of terrestrial objects and celestial bodies follows the same laws of nature; It provides strong theoretical support for the heliocentric theory and is a major representative of the scientific revolution.

In mechanics, Newton elucidated the principle of conservation of momentum and angular momentum. Optically, he invented the reflecting telescope and developed a theory of color based on the observation that a prism diverges white light into the visible spectrum. He also systematically formulated the law of cooling and studied the speed of sound.

In mathematics, Newton shared the honor of developing calculus with Gottfried · Leibniz. He also proved the generalized binomial theorem, proposed the "Newtonian method" to approximate the zero point of a function, and contributed to the study of power series.

In 2005, the Royal Society of United Kingdom launched a poll on "Who is the most influential person in the history of science", and Newton won the crown in the voting of the Royal Society Fellows and netizens.

### **Max Planck**

![Max Planck](/images/Max%20Planck.jpg)

Max Karl Ernst Ludwig Planck (April 23, 1858 – October 4, 1947) was a Germany physicist and one of the founders of quantum mechanics. He was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1918 (awarded in 1919) for his discovery of energy quanta. The Planck constant, which bears his name, was used in 2019 to redefine the basic unit. In addition, there are many scientific trophies, institutions and societies that bear his name.

It was around 1894 that Planck began to devote all his energies to the study of blackbody radiation. Shortly thereafter, on December 14, 1900, Planck came up with a theoretical corollary of the radiation law, in which he used the statistical mechanics of the Austrian physicist Ludwig · Boltzmann, whom he had previously denied. Planck proposed the hypothesis of energy quantization at the conference: E=hv, where E is energy, ν is the frequency, and an important physical constant, h, is introduced, the Planck constant, and energy can only be radiated outward in the form of an indivisible energy element (i.e., quanta). Such a hypothesis reconciles the contradictions encountered in the study of the law of thermal radiation in classical physics. Based on this assumption, he also gave Planck's formula for black-body radiation, which satisfactorily explained the experimental phenomenon. Planck was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1918. Although Planck tried to bring his theories within the framework of classical physics in later years, he is still regarded as one of the pioneers of modern physics.

Planck rejected the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics proposed by Bohr, Werner· Heisenberg, and Pauli at the end of the 20th century, as opposed to Schrödinger and Max· von · Laue, and Einstein became a conservative at this time. Planck considered Heisenberg's matrix mechanics "disgusting" and looked to the Schrödinger equation as a savior. Planck felt that wave dynamics would soon make his own quantum theory redundant, but scientific truths continued to be revealed despite his ideas.

### **Chienshiung Wu**

![Chienshiung Wu](/images/Chienshiung%20Wu.jpg)

Chienshiung Wu (May 31, 1912 – February 16, 1997) was a Chinese-American physicist who made significant contributions to the field of nuclear physics, and her achievements in experimental physics often compared her to Marie · Curie. Wu Chien-shiung was the first female president of the United States Physical Society and is often referred to as "China's Marie Curie," "the first lady of physics research," "the queen of nuclear research," and "one of the world's most outstanding female experimental physicists."

Wu Chien-shiung graduated from National Central University of the Republic of China and the University of California, Berkeley, United States, under the tutelage of Nobel Laureate Ernest · Lawrence. During the Manhattan Project, she was involved in the study of how to separate two isotopes of uranium (uranium-235 and uranium-238) using gas diffusion.

A longtime faculty member at United States Colombia University, Wu is best known for her experimental verification of the non-conservation of universal symmetry. Enrico · Fermi had published his theory of β decay in 1934, but an experiment conducted by Louis · Alvarets yielded results that were different from the theory. Wu tried to repeat the experiment to test the results. After refining the experiments, the experimental results she obtained were consistent with Fermi's theoretical results, which means that the difference between Alvarets's experimental results and Fermi's theoretical results was only an experimental error. A series of experiments conducted by Wu Chien-shiung confirmed that the universe is indeed not conserved in weak interactions. The non-conservation of cosmic symmetry is an important discovery in the field of particle physics, which is very important for the establishment of the Standard Model.

This earned her colleagues Tsung-Dao Lee and Chen-Ning Yang the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1957 and the Wolf Prize in Physics for the first time in 1978.
