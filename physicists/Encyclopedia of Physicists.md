### **Albert Einstein**

Albert · Einstein (March 14, 1879 – April 18, 1955), a Jewish theoretical physicist born in Germany with Switzerland and United States nationality, founded the theory of relativity, which is considered one of the two pillars of modern physics, and also made outstanding achievements in the field of quantum mechanics. He is the discoverer of the mass-energy equivalence formula (E = mc2). He was also influential in the field of philosophy of science. He was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921 for his "contributions to theoretical physics, in particular the discovery of the principle of the photoelectric effect". This discovery is a crucial step in the establishment of quantum theory.

Albert Einstein discovered early in his career that classical mechanics and electromagnetic fields could not coexist with each other, leading to the development of the special theory of relativity. He also discovered that the principles of relativity could be extended to the modeling of gravitational fields. Based on some theories of gravity, he published the general theory of relativity in 1915. His continued research on statistical mechanics and quantum theory led him to derive explanations for particle theory and molecular motion. In 1917, Albert Einstein applied the theory of general relativity to model the large-scale structure of the universe.

When Adolf · Hitler came to power as chancellor of Germany in 1933, Einstein was visiting the United States. Since Einstein was Jewish, he did not return to Germany despite being a professor at the Prussian Academy of Sciences. In 1940, he settled in United States and subsequently became a United States citizen. On the eve of World War II, he signed a letter to then United States President Franklin · Roosevelt, in which he suggested that Germany might develop a new and powerful bomb, and suggested that United States should also conduct research on it as soon as possible, United States the Manhattan Project began. Einstein supported the strengthening of the Allies' armed forces, but condemned the idea of using the then-newly discovered nuclear fission for weapons purposes, and Einstein later signed the Russell-Einstein Declaration with the United Kingdom philosopher Bertrand · Russell, emphasizing the dangers of nuclear weapons.

Albert Einstein was one of the most important scientists of the 20th century, publishing more than 300 scientific papers and 150 non-scientific works in his lifetime, and is known as the "father of modern physics". His scientific achievements of excellence and originality have made the term "Einstein" synonymous with "genius".
