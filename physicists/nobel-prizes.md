## **2022**

### [Alain Aspect](https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/2022/aspect/facts/)

- **Born**: 1947-06-15, France
- **Affiliation**: École Polytechnique, France
- **Motivation**  
  for experiments with entangled photons, establishing the violation of Bell inequalities and pioneering quantum information science
- **Work**  
  One of the most remarkable traits of quantum mechanics is that it allows two or more particles to exist in what is called an entangled state. What happens to one of the particles in an entangled pair determines what happens to the other particle, even if they are far apart. In 1981–1982, Alain Aspect conducted groundbreaking experiments using entangled light particles, photons. These and other experiments confirm that quantum mechanics is correct and pave the way for quantum computers, quantum networks and quantum encrypted communication.

### [Syukuro Manabe](https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/2021/manabe/facts/)

- **Born**: 1931-09-21, Japan
- **Affiliation**: Princeton University, USA
- **Motivation**  
  for the physical modelling of Earth’s climate, quantifying variability and reliably predicting global warming
- **Work**  
  Our world is full of complex systems characterised by randomness and disorder. One complex system of vital importance to humankind is Earth’s climate. Syukuro Manabe demonstrated how increased levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere lead to increased temperatures at the surface of the Earth. In the 1960s, he led the development of physical models of the Earth’s climate and was the first person to explore the interaction between radiation balance and the vertical transport of air masses. His work laid the foundation for the development of current climate models.

- **Affiliation**: Max Planck Institute for Meteorology, Germany
- **Motivation**  
  for the physical modelling of Earth’s climate, quantifying variability and reliably predicting global warming
- **Work**  
  Our world is full of complex systems characterised by randomness and disorder. One complex system of vital importance to humankind is Earth’s climate. In the 1970s, Klaus Hasselmann created a model that links together weather and climate, thus answering the question of why climate models can be reliable despite weather being changeable and chaotic. He also developed methods for identifying specific signals that both natural phenomena and human activities imprint in the climate. An important result is that the increased temperature in the atmosphere is due to human emissions of carbon dioxide.

### [Giorgio Parisi](https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/2021/parisi/facts/)

- **Born**: 1948-08-04, Italy
- **Affiliation**: Sapienza University of Rome, Italy
- **Motivation**  
  for the discovery of the interplay of disorder and fluctuations in physical systems from atomic to planetary scales
- **Work**  
  Our world is full of complex systems characterised by randomness and disorder. Around 1980, Giorgio Parisi discovered hidden patterns in disordered complex materials. His discoveries are among the most important contributions to the theory of complex systems. They make it possible to understand and describe many different and apparently entirely random materials and phenomena, not only in physics but also in other, very different areas, such as mathematics, biology, neuroscience and machine learning.

### [Roger Penrose](https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/2020/penrose/facts/)

- **Born**: 1931-08-08, United Kingdom
- **Affiliation**: University College London, United Kingdom
- **Motivation**  
  for the discovery that black hole formation is a robust prediction of the general theory of relativity
- **Work**  
  A black hole is a supermassive compact object with a gravitational force so large that nothing, not even light, can escape from it. In 1964, Roger Penrose proposed critical mathematical tools to describe black holes. He showed that Einstein’s general theory of relativity means the formation of black holes must be seen as a natural process in the development of the universe. He was also able to describe black holes in detail: at their farthest depths is a singularity where all known laws of nature dissolve.

- **Born**: 1952-03-24, Germany
- **Affiliation**: University of California, Berkeley, USA
- **Motivation**  
  for the discovery of a supermassive compact object at the centre of our galaxy
- **Work**  
  A black hole is a supermassive compact object with a gravitational force so large that nothing, not even light, can escape from it. Since nothing, not even light, can escape black holes, they can only be observed by the radiation and the movement of nearby objects. Since the 1990s, Reinhard Genzel and Andrea Ghez with their respective research teams, have developed and refined techniques for studying the movement of stars. Observations of stars in the area around Sagittarius A\* in the middle of our galaxy, the Milky Way, revealed a super massive black hole.

- **Affiliation**: Chinese University of Hong Kong, China
- **Motivation**  
  for groundbreaking achievements concerning the transmission of light in fibers for optical communication
- **Work**  
  The rapid transmission of signals over long distances is fundamental to the flow of information in our time. Since the 1930s thin filaments, or fibers, of glass have been used to see inside the body, but these long remained unusable for long-distance information transfer because too much light was lost along the way. In the 1960s Charles Kao presented a solution: fibers of very pure glass transported sufficient light. Together with laser technology, his solution has made telecommunication using optical fibers possible.

- **Work**  
  The ability to store images in a digital format is an important prerequisite for information technology. In 1969 Willard Boyle and George Smith sketched an electronic memory design, but their concept instead became the basis for a light sensitive charge coupled device, or CCD. In the sensor there is a grid of light sensitive cells that emit electrons when exposed to light, causing the cells to become electrically charged. When a voltage is applied to the cells, electrical signals are generated, which are used to build up a digital image. CCD was a breakthrough for digital camera technology.

- **Affiliation**: University of Chicago, USA
- **Motivation**  
  for the discovery of the mechanism of spontaneous broken symmetry in subatomic physics
- **Work**  
  For a long time, physicists assumed that various symmetries characterized nature. In a kind of “mirror world” where right and left were reversed and matter was replaced by antimatter, the same physical laws would apply, they posited. However, symmetries had been proven to be violated at times. In 1960, Yoichiro Nambu formulated a mathematical theory for understanding spontaneous symmetry violations, providing a basis for better understanding elementary particles and their interactions.

- **Work**  
  Physicists long assumed that nature is characterized by symmetry. In a kind of mirrored world where right and left changed places and matter was exchanged for antimatter, natural laws would stand. After it was discovered that the decay of certain particles (kaons) was asymmetrical, a mathematics-based explanation for this was presented by Makoto Kobayashi and Toshihide Maskawa in 1972. The explanation meant that there must be at least three families of quarks that form matter. This theory was later verified.

  Various types of particles and radiation travel through outer space, including cosmic background radiation, which has been carefully studied through measurements from the COBE satellite. John Mather, a driving force in the project, had particular responsibility for a part that in 1989 indicated that cosmic background radiation’s spectrum corresponds to black-body radiation—radiation emitted by a dark, glowing body. The result provided evidence that the background radiation is a remnant from the creation of the universe in the Big Bang.

- **Work**  
  According to quantum physics, which was developed at the beginning of the 20th century, light and other electromagnetic radiation appear in the form of quanta, packets with fixed energies, which can be described as both waves and as particles, photons. However, no real in-depth theory of light based on quantum theory existed before Roy Glauber established the foundation for quantum optics in 1963. This required the development of the laser. Its concentrated and coherent light gave rise to more quantum physical phenomena than regular light.

  According to quantum physics, light and other electromagnetic radiation appear in the form of quanta, packets with fixed energies, which also correspond to energy transitions in atoms. Consequently, determining the frequency of light waves provides information about the atoms’ properties, benchmarks for time and length, and the possibility of determining physical constants. Around the year 2000, John Hall and Theodor Hänsch developed the frequency comb technique, in which laser light with a series of equidistant frequencies is used to measure frequencies with great precision.

- **Work**  
  The atomic nucleus is held together by a powerful, strong interaction that binds together the protons and neutrons that comprise the nucleus. The strong interaction also holds together the quarks that make up protons and neutrons. This interaction is so strong that no free quarks have ever been observed. However, in 1973 David Gross, David Politzer, and Frank Wilczek came up with a theory postulating that when quarks come really close to one another, the attraction abates and they behave like free particles. This is called asymptotic freedom.

  When certain substances are cooled to extremely low temperatures, they become superconductors, conducting electrical current entirely without resistance. With one type of superconductivity, the magnetic field is forced away from the conductor, but with another type of superconductivity, the magnetic field is admitted into the conductor. The different types of superconductivity cannot be described with the same theory. At the end of the 1950s, Alexei Abrikosov formulated a theory for the second type of superconductor. He introduced a mathematical function that described vortexes whereby an external magnetic field can intrude into the conductor.

  In certain nuclear reactions (such as when protons combine to form helium nuclei) elusive particles called neutrinos are created. Raymond Davies wanted to detect neutrinos in radiation from space to confirm the theory that this kind of nuclear reaction is the source of the sun’s energy. Beginning in the 1960s, he placed a large tank containing a chlorine-rich liquid inside a mine. In rare cases, a neutrino interacted with a chlorine atom to form an argon atom. By counting these argon atoms, neutrinos from space could be detected.

- **Work**  
  Stars and galaxies emit not only visible light, but also X-rays.

With the telescopes, he discovered X-ray sources outside our own solar system, cosmic background radiation with X-ray wavelengths as well as X-ray sources that probably contain black holes.

When atoms come in contact with light particles with fixed energies, photons, their movement is affected as if they had been bumped. With the aid of laser light from different directions and adjustment of the photon’s energy for Doppler effects, the atoms can be cooled to extremely low temperatures and captured in a trap.

  for their discovery of superfluidity in helium-3
- **Work**  
  When certain substances are cooled to extremely low temperatures, they become superfluid, flowing without any friction. This applies to helium-4, the most common form of helium, but for a long time the superfluidity of helium-3 was in dispute. The different types of helium are described by different quantum mechanical rules and equations under which helium-4 has a whole-number spin while helium-3 has a half-number spin. In 1972 David Lee, Douglas Osheroff, and Robert Richardson verified that helium-3 also becomes superfluid at extremely low temperatures.

- **Work**  
  During the beta decay of a nucleus, a neutron is converted to a proton and an electron is produced. In studying the electron’s velocity, it was clear that this decay violated energy-conversation and other laws. It was thus proposed that an additional particle—a neutrino—was formed during beta decay. In the early 1950s, Frederick Reines passed radiation from a nuclear reactor through a water tank and discovered reactions that proved the neutrino’s existence.

- **Work**  
  Atomic nuclei are composed of protons and neutrons. Bertram Brockhouse and Clifford Shull developed methods for investigating different materials with beams of neutrons created in a nuclear reactor. When neutron beams come in contact with a material, some of the neutron’s energy is converted into vibrations. The vibrations, known as phonons, correspond to fixed energy levels that form a spectrum. During the 1950s Bertram Brockhouse developed methods for using these spectrums to chart properties of different molecules and materials.

- **Work**  
  Pulsars are very compact stars that radiate radio waves with very regular variations. In 1974 Russell Hulse and James Taylor discovered a pulsar comprised of two stars in very close proximity that rotate around each other. Hulse and Taylor could demonstrate that the stars’ radiation and movements correspond with Einstein’s general theory of relativity. Among other things, this theory predicts that the pulsar would emit energy in the form of gravitational waves, which should result in slowly declining intervals. Taylor was able to confirm this in 1978.

  When onrushing particles collide and form showers of new particles, they offer a key to understanding the smallest components of matter.

The multiwire chamber contains many parallel metal wires surrounded by a gas. Between the chamber’s walls and the threads, an electrical charge is introduced. When particles enter, electrons in the gas are liberated in cascading fashion. Currents are generated in the wires and are registered and processed using computers.

  An accumulation of matter with uniform physical and chemical properties is said to be in a certain phase, such as solid, liquid or gas. Magnetism and the orientation of molecules can also give rise to different phases. Different phases are characterized by different forms of order and disorder. During the 1970s Pierre Gilles de Gennes showed how transitions from order to disorder come about, especially for liquid crystals and polymers in solution. He demonstrated that the results apply to a number of different types of phase transitions.

  According to the laws of quantum mechanics, atoms can have only fixed energy levels.

After Isaac Isidor Rabi developed a method to determine these frequencies by passing a beam of atoms through a magnetic and electromagnetic field, Norman Ramsey refined the method in 1949 through the interference of two electromagnetic fields. This improved precision and became the basis for the atomic clock.

- **Born**: 1906-12-25, Germany
- **Affiliation**: Fritz-Haber-Institut der Max-Planck-Gesellschaft, Germany
- **Motivation**  
  for his fundamental work in electron optics, and for the design of the first electron microscope
- **Work**  
  Very small objects can be studied in a microscope, but when objects become as small as the wavelength of light, an image no longer is produced. The discovery that beams of electrons behave as waves with wavelengths shorter than visible light opened up new opportunities. Ernst Ruska discovered that a magnetic coil could be used as a lens for electron beams and developed the first electron microscope in 1933. It captures images of extremely small objects by means of electron beams that are directed towards an object and captured on a screen.

### [Gerd Binnig](https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/1986/binnig/facts/)

- **Born**: 1947-07-20, Germany
- **Affiliation**: IBM Zurich Research Laboratory, Switzerland
- **Motivation**  
  for their design of the scanning tunneling microscope
- **Work**  
  In optical microscopes the size of objects that can be observed is limited by the wavelength of light. In 1981 Gerd Binnig and Heinrich Röhrer developed the scanning tunneling microscope, which transcends this limit. The instrument is based on an extremely thin point that passes very close to a surface. A low electrical charge is positioned between the point and the surface, and through a quantum mechanical effect, the tunnel effect, a current arises that varies with the distance from the surface. The current is registered and allows the creation of an image in which objects as small as individual atoms can be distinguished.

## **1985**

### [Klaus von Klitzing](https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/1985/klitzing/facts/)

- **Born**: 1943-06-28, Poland
- **Affiliation**: Max-Planck-Institut für Festkörperforschung, Germany
- **Motivation**  
  for the discovery of the quantized Hall effect
- **Work**  
  If an electrical current flows lengthwise through a metal band and a magnetic field is placed against the surface of the band at a right angle, a charge arises diagonally in the band. Known as the Hall effect, it comes about because the movement of the electrons is deflected by the magnetic field. In 1980, Klaus von Klitzing discovered the quantum Hall effect in an interface between a metal and a semiconductor in a very clean material. In this effect, changes in the magnetic field result in changes in what is known as Hall conductance that vary in steps of whole-number multiples of a constant.

- **Affiliation**: University of Chicago, USA
- **Motivation**  
  for his theoretical studies of the physical processes of importance to the structure and evolution of the stars
- **Work**  
  Stars in the universe form from clouds of gas and dust. When these clouds are pulled together by gravitational force, energy is released in the form of heat. And when a high enough temperature is reached, reactions among the atomic nuclei in the star’s interior begin. Beginning in the 1930s, Subramanyan Chandrasekhar formulated theories for the development that stars subsequently undergo. He showed that when the hydrogen fuel of stars of a certain size begins to run out, it collapses into a compact, brilliant star known as a white dwarf.

  Stars in the universe form from clouds of gas and dust. When these clouds are pulled together by gravitational force, energy is released in the form of heat. And when a high enough temperature is reached, reactions among the atomic nuclei in the star’s interior begin. These reactions are what causes radiation from stars. In the 1950s William Fowler showed how these nuclear reactions also account for how various elements are formed. These processes have created the elements that make up our earth and other heavenly bodies in the universe.

### [Kenneth G. Wilson](https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/1982/wilson/facts/) <span style='color:grey;font-weight:lighter'>(Deceased)</font>

- **Born**: 1936-06-08, USA
- **Affiliation**: Cornell University, USA
- **Motivation**  
  for his theory for critical phenomena in connection with phase transitions
- **Work**  
  An accumulation of matter with uniform physical and chemical properties is said to be in a certain phase, such as solid, liquid or gas. There also are other phases, for example, when dealing with magnetism. A theoretical understanding of critical points for phase transitions requires a broad spectrum of scaling. Early attempts to explain this in one step led to infinities in the result. Kenneth Wilson solved the problem in 1971 through a type of renormalization, which can be described as solving the problem piece by piece.

- **Affiliation**: Harvard University, USA
- **Motivation**  
  for their contribution to the development of laser spectroscopy
- **Work**  
  Electrons in atoms and molecules have fixed energy levels, according to the principles of quantum physics. When there are transitions among different energy levels, light with certain frequencies is emitted or absorbed. This allows atoms and molecules to be analyzed with the help of the absorbed light’s spectrum. In the 1960s Nicolaas Bloembergen used laser light, which has waves in phase and of the same wavelength, to determine energy levels with great precision. By coordinating three laser waves, a fourth laser wave was created, and a larger part of the spectrum could be covered.

- **Work**  
  According to quantum physics principles, the electrons in atoms and molecules have defined energy levels. Albert Einstein’s theory of the “photoelectric effect” says that a light particle (photon) can liberate an electron from an atom if it has sufficient energy. In the 1950s Kai Siegbahn developed methods for achieving highly accurate measurements of energy levels in atoms by irradiating them with photons and measuring the energy of the electrons emitted using the photoelectric effect.

- **Affiliation**: University of Chicago, USA
- **Motivation**  
  for the discovery of violations of fundamental symmetry principles in the decay of neutral K-mesons
- **Work**  
  For a long time, physicists assumed that various symmetries characterized nature. In a kind of “mirror world” where right and left were reversed and matter was replaced by antimatter, the same physical laws would apply, they posited. The left-right symmetry had already been proven violated when, in 1964, James Cronin and Val Fitch discovered that the matter-antimatter symmetry is violated when the neutral K-meson decays. Their experiment also proved that symmetry does not apply during time reversal: reactions going backward in time are not identical to those going forward.

  for their contributions to the theory of the unified weak and electromagnetic interaction between elementary particles, including, inter alia, the prediction of the weak neutral current
- **Work**  
  According to modern physics, four fundamental forces exist in nature. Electromagnetic interaction is one of these. The weak interaction—responsible, for example, for the beta decay of nuclei—is another. Thanks to contributions made by Sheldon Glashow, Abdus Salam, and Steven Weinberg in 1968, these two interactions were unified to one single, called electroweak. The theory predicted, for example, that weak interaction manifests itself in “neutral weak currents” when certain elementary particles interact. This was later confirmed.

In 1934 Piotr Kapitsa developed a method for producing liquid helium in large quantities. This became very important for a number of experiments. Among other things, Kapitsa discovered in 1937 that at very low temperatures liquid helium flows without resistance. The phenomenon became known as superfluidity.

  Radiation falls toward the earth from outer space. This cosmic radiation initially appeared to become weaker as wavelengths of the radiation became shorter. However, when Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson studied cosmic radiation in 1964, they discovered that microwaves with a wavelength of about 7 centimeters were stronger than expected. At first they thought that the results were caused by distortions or faults in the measurements, but that was not the case. This cosmic background radiation probably is a remnant of the Big Bang when the universe was created.

  Solid materials often have a regular crystalline structure and composition, but sometimes they constitute disordered systems. These could be alloys with a regular structure but a more random composition. Other solid materials, such as glass, lack a regular structure. In 1958 Philip Anderson showed the conditions under which an electron can move about freely within a disordered system and when it is more or less bound to a specific place. This and other works have contributed to a deeper understanding of electrical phenomena in disordered systems.

He also showed how the interaction between the electron’s movements can create local magnetic moments in crystals.

- **Motivation**  
  for the discovery of the connection between collective motion and particle motion in atomic nuclei and the development of the theory of the structure of the atomic nucleus based on this connection
- **Work**  
  According to modern physics, an atomic nucleus consists of nucleons—protons and neutrons. In earlier models the nucleus was depicted as being spherical, but this proved to be inaccurate. In 1950 James Rainwater postulated that the atomic nucleus can be distorted. The nucleons in the outer portions of the atomic nucleus move about in paths and interact with nucleons inside, causing the nucleus to be distorted. Independently of Rainwater, Aage Bohr arrived at the same theory and corroborated it through experiments in collaboration with Ben Mottelson in 1952 and 1953.

  When certain metals are cooled to extremely low temperatures, they become superconductors, conducting electrical current entirely without resistance. Based on quantum mechanics, John Bardeen, Leon Cooper, and Robert Schrieffer formulated a theory for the phenomenon in 1957. At extremely low temperatures, the interaction between electrons and atoms in the metals’ crystalline structure causes the electrons to pair up with one another. As a result, their movement becomes orderly, unlike the random movement at normal temperatures, and electrical resistance disappears.

  During the 19th century photographic methods were developed that resulted in two-dimensional images. In 1951 Dennis Gabor discovered a way of producing images with the illusion of depth. The method was based on interference—interaction between light waves—and coherence—light waves aligned in phase with one another. Light falling on an object is captured on photographic film along with a reference beam that did not fall on the object. When only the reference beam falls on the developed film, the light is bent so that a reproduction with depth is produced.

  Electrons in atoms and molecules have fixed energy levels, according to the principles of quantum physics. When there are transitions among different energy levels, light with certain frequencies is emitted or absorbed. In 1950 Alfred Kastler presented the idea that electrons, with the help of light or other electromagnetic radiation, can be pumped up to fixed higher energy levels and then fall back to fixed lower levels. This made precise determination of energy levels possible and also was of fundamental importance for development of the laser.

  Following the establishment of the theory of relativity and quantum mechanics, an initial relativistic theory was formulated for the interaction between charged particles and electromagnetic fields. The theory had to be reformulated, however, partly due to the observation of the Lamb shift in 1947, in which the supposed single energy level within a hydrogen atom was instead proven to be two similar levels. Sin-Itiro Tomonga solved this problem in 1948 through a “renormalization” and thereby contributed to a new quantum electrodynamics.

- **Work**  
  Stimulated emission means that a light packet, a photon, coming in contact with an atom can cause an electron to descend to a lower energy level so that an additional photon with the same amount of energy is emitted. If electrons are elevated to higher energy levels with the help of heat or light, an avalanche-like effect occurs when they fall to lower levels. In the 1950s Charles Townes, Nicolay Basov, and Aleksandr Prokhorov contributed to putting this phenomenon into practical use in masers and lasers, which produce concentrated and coherent beams of microwaves and light, respectively.

  Stimulated emission means that a light packet, a photon, coming in contact with an atom can cause an electron to descend to a lower energy level so that an additional photon with the same amount of energy is emitted.

  After discovery of the neutron, it became evident that the atomic nucleus is made up of nucleons—protons and neutrons—that are affected by a cohesive force. In 1933 Eugene Wigner discovered that the force binding the nucleons together is very weak when the distance between them is great, but very strong when the nucleons are close to one another as in the atomic nucleus. Wigner also described several characteristics of the nucleons and the nuclear force, including the fact that the force between two nucleons is the same, regardless of whether they are protons or neutrons.

  According to modern physics, an atom consists of a nucleus made up of nucleons—protons and neutrons—surrounded by electrons distributed within shells with a fixed number of electrons. It became apparent that atomic nuclei in which the number of nucleons corresponded to full electron shells are especially stable. In 1949 Hans Jensen and Maria Goeppert Mayer developed a model in which nucleons were distributed in shells with different energy levels. The model reflected observations of directions in which nucleons rotated around their own axes and around the center of the nucleus.

  When certain substances are cooled to very low temperatures, their properties undergo radical changes.

One of Lev Landau’s many contributions within theoretical physics came in 1941, when he applied quantum theory to the movement of superfluid liquid helium. Among other things, he introduced the concept of quasiparticles as the equivalent of sound vibrations and vortexes. This allowed him to develop his theoretical explanation for superfluidity.

  According to the principles of quantum physics, the atomic nucleus and surrounding electrons can have only fixed energy levels. When there are transitions among energy levels in the atomic nucleus, high-energy photons known as gamma rays are emitted and absorbed. In a gas a recoil effect occurs when an atom emits a photon. In 1958 Rudolf Mössbauer discovered that the recoil can be eliminated if the atoms are embedded in a crystal structure. This opened up opportunities to study energy levels in atomic nuclei and how these are affected by their surroundings and various phenomena.

On their way through a medium, charged particles disturb electrons in the medium. When these resume their position, they emit light. Normally this does not produce any light that can be observed, but if the particle moves faster than light, a kind of backwash of light appears.

- **Motivation**  
  for the coincidence method and his discoveries made therewith
- **Work**  
  In a counter tube, particles passing through the tube generate an electric pulse. In 1925 Walter Bothe connected two counter tubes together so that only simultaneous passages were registered. This meant that either the passages were caused by particles that originated from the same event or by a particle that moved so fast that the time for movement between the tubes was negligible. Bothe used the method to show that energy is conserved in impacts between particles and photons and to study cosmic radiation.

  for his demonstration of the phase contrast method, especially for his invention of the phase contrast microscope
- **Work**  
  When light passes through a transparent object, there is a change in the phase of the light waves, the position of the wave crests’ in relation to one another. Our eye does not perceive this, but in the beginning of the 1930s, Frits Zernike developed a way to make it visible. A light beam is passed through an object while a reference beam goes by it. When the beams are brought together, they are strengthened or canceled out because of phase displacement, and the object is outlined more clearly in contrast to its surroundings. The phase contrast microscope became particularly important in the study of living cells.

- **Work**  
  When radio signals were sent across the Atlantic at the beginning of the 20th century, it became apparent that the radio waves followed the earth’s curvature. Physicists assumed that the radio waves were being reflected from a layer in the atmosphere where the sun’s ultraviolet light had liberated electrons from their atoms. By studying the superposition, or interference, of radio waves that had taken different paths, Edward Appleton established the existence of this layer—the ionosphere—in 1924. In 1927 he demonstrated that an additional layer existed outside the one discovered previously. Appleton’s methods also came to have implications for the development of radar.

  At very high pressures, matter takes on other properties and forms than under ordinary conditions. When Percy Bridgman set out to study optical phenomena under high pressure in 1905, some of the equipment broke apart. When he was going to repair it, he came up with an idea for a sealing device that proved to be more effective than expected. This led him to further develop equipment that could produce extremely high pressures. This allowed the examination of the altered structure and properties of various substances and materials under high pressure.

  In certain respects, electrons and atoms act like rotating charges that generate magnetic fields.

According to classical physics, the beam should have spread out to a distribution, but instead, two distinct beams were observed. The result supported quantum physics’ theory that electrons and atoms occupy only certain states of energy and movement. Angular momentum was proven to be quantized.

  If the nuclei of atoms are bombarded by beams of particles, such as protons, the atoms can be transformed into different variants of the element with different masses, so-called isotopes. The likelihood that particles can penetrate the atomic nucleus and bring about a nuclear reaction increases if the bombarding particles have a high velocity. In 1929 Ernest Lawrence developed an apparatus known as a cyclotron that used electrical and magnetic fields to accelerate protons to high velocities in a spiral-shaped path before they collide with their target.

  During the intense period of 1925-26 quantum theories were proposed that accurately described the energy levels of electrons in atoms. These equations needed to be adapted to Einstein’s theory of relativity, however. In 1928 Paul Dirac formulated a fully relativistic quantum theory. The equation gave solutions that he interpreted as being caused by a particle equivalent to the electron, but with a positive charge. This particle, the positron, was later confirmed through experiments.

These equations needed to be adapted to Einstein’s theory of relativity, however. In 1928 Paul Dirac formulated a fully relativistic quantum theory. The equation gave solutions that he interpreted as being caused by a particle equivalent to the electron, but with a positive charge. This particle, the positron, was later confirmed through experiments.

## **1932**

### [Werner Karl Heisenberg](https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/1932/heisenberg/facts/) <span style='color:grey;font-weight:lighter'>(Deceased)</font>

- **Born**: 1901-12-05, Germany
- **Affiliation**: Leipzig University, Germany
- **Motivation**  
  for the creation of quantum mechanics, the application of which has, inter alia, led to the discovery of the allotropic forms of hydrogen
- **Work**  
  In Niels Bohr’s theory of the atom, electrons absorb and emit radiation of fixed wavelengths when jumping between fixed orbits around a nucleus. The theory provided a good description of the spectrum created by the hydrogen atom, but needed to be developed to suit more complicated atoms and molecules. In 1925, Werner Heisenberg formulated a type of quantum mechanics based on matrices. In 1927 he proposed the “uncertainty relation”, setting limits for how precisely the position and velocity of a particle can be simultaneously determined.

### [Sir Chandrasekhara Venkata Raman](https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/1930/raman/facts/) <span style='color:grey;font-weight:lighter'>(Deceased)</font>

- **Born**: 1888-11-07, India
- **Affiliation**: Calcutta University, India
- **Motivation**  
  for his work on the scattering of light and for the discovery of the effect named after him
- **Work**  
  When light meets particles that are smaller than the light’s wavelength, the light spreads in different directions. This occurs, for example, when light packets—photons—encounter molecules in a gas. In 1928 Venkata Raman discovered that a small portion of the scattered light acquires other wavelengths than that of the original light. This is because some of the incoming photons’ energy can be transferred to a molecule, giving it a higher level of energy. Among other things, the phenomenon is used to analyze different types of material.

- **Affiliation**: Sorbonne University, France
- **Motivation**  
  for his discovery of the wave nature of electrons
- **Work**  
  In the beginning of the 20th century, quantum physics evolved from the idea that energy is conveyed in only certain fixed amounts. An early finding indicated that light can be regarded as both waves and particles. In 1924 Louis de Broglie introduced the idea that particles, such as electrons, could be described not only as particles but also as waves. This was substantiated by the way streams of electrons were reflected against crystals and spread through thin metal foils. The idea had great significance for the continued evolution of quantum mechanics.

  “for his work on the thermionic phenomenon and especially for the discovery of the law named after him”
- **Work**  
  When a metal wire becomes hot and starts to glow, the air around the wire becomes electrically charged. This phenomenon was used earlier to amplify electrical signals in telephone lines and other applications. In 1901 Owen Richardson explained the phenomenon, declaring that when metal becomes hot, the electrons in the metal become so agitated that they are liberated from their atoms and cast into the air where they act as free charged particles. Richardson also formulated a law that describes the relationship between emissions of electrons and temperature.

  According to Einstein’s photoelectric effect theory, light consists of quanta, “packages” with definite energies corresponding to certain frequencies. A light quantum is called a photon. When Arthur Compton directed X-ray photons onto a metal surface in 1922, electrons were emancipated and the X-rays’ wavelength increased because some of the incident photon energy was transferred to the electrons. The experiment confirmed that electromagnetic radiation could also be described as photon particles following the laws of mechanics.

  for his work on the discontinuous structure of matter, and especially for his discovery of sedimentation equilibrium
- **Work**  
  During the 1880s atoms and molecules became important scientific concepts, but whether or not they actually had a physical existence was still a matter of dispute. Jean Perrin maintained that if molecules were real, particles blended into a liquid should not all sink to the bottom but should distribute themselves throughout the liquid. In 1908 he could substantiate this through experimentation. He also substantiated Einstein’s theory that Brownian motion—the random movement of small particles in a liquid—was due to collisions between the particles and molecules in the liquid.

  In 1914, Gustav Hertz and James Franck conducted an experiment, in which a potential difference was applied to a tube containing a low-pressure gas. When increased, the current flowing through the tube also increased until the voltage reached a certain level, when it suddenly declined. The result supported Niels Bohr’s theory on the structure of the atom, in which electrons can only have specific, discrete energies. The potential difference increased the free electrons’ mobility until, at a certain energy level, bound electrons jumped to a higher-energy orbit instead.

  Precise measurement plays an important role in science. To provide a basis for precise measurements, the metric system and a German legal meter were instituted to define lengths. However, different materials expand differently when temperatures change, which limits the ability to make very precise measurements. In 1896 Charles-Edouard Guillaume succeeded in finding an alloy of nickel and steel that registered almost no change in length and volume as a result of temperature changes. The invar nickel-steel alloy had a significant effect on scientific instruments and incandescent light bulbs.

Röntgen (1901 Physics Laureate) as a professor in Würzburg. Wien’s research concerned how various metals radiate heat, and he received the Nobel Prize for the law of black-body radiation, now known as Wien-Planck’s law. It was drawn up jointly with Max Planck (Physics, 1918) and many felt that they should have shared in the award.

## **1910**

### [Johannes Diderik van der Waals](https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/1910/waals/facts/) <span style='color:grey;font-weight:lighter'>(Deceased)</font>

- **Born**: 1837-11-23, Netherlands
- **Affiliation**: University of Leiden, Netherlands
- **Motivation**  
  for his work on the equation of state for gases and liquids
- **Work**  
  Johannes Diderik van der Waals worked as a teacher in Leiden. He wanted to pursue university studies, but lacked training in classical languages, which was a requirement. Instead, he began attending lectures in physics in his free time. Once the classical language requirements were eliminated, he quickly completed his degree, and in 1876 he became professor of physics at the University of Amsterdam. In his work with the equation of state for gases and liquids, for which he received the Nobel Prize, he also studied the forces between molecules, which are called van der Waals forces in his honor.

- **Affiliation**: Marconi Wireless Telegraph Co. Ltd., United Kingdom
- **Motivation**  
  in recognition of their contributions to the development of wireless telegraphy
- **Work**  
  In the late 1880s a previously unknown type of radiation was discovered—radio waves. It was found to have the same nature as light, but with a greater wavelength. Various physicists and technicians investigated whether radio waves could be used to transmit signals. In 1895, Guglielmo Marconi used radio waves to transmit signals over a distance of several kilometers. He developed the technology in subsequent years to achieve greater range. The foundation for both wireless telegraphy and radio had been laid.

## **1908**

### [Gabriel Lippmann](https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/1908/lippmann/facts/) <span style='color:grey;font-weight:lighter'>(Deceased)</font>

- **Born**: 1845-08-16, Luxembourg
- **Affiliation**: Sorbonne University, France
- **Motivation**  
  for his method of reproducing colours photographically based on the phenomenon of interference
- **Work**  
  During the 19th century methods were developed for producing black-and-white photographs with the help of light-sensitive silver halides. In the 1890s Gabriel Lippmann discovered a method for color photography based on interference—interaction between light waves. Using a mirror, light was reflected through a photographic emulsion in which the interference phenomenon produces a number of blackened layers. The distance between the layers corresponds to certain wavelengths and can be transmuted into a color image. The method never came into widespread usage, but lived on as a physics experiment.

### [Albert Abraham Michelson](https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/1907/michelson/facts/) <span style='color:grey;font-weight:lighter'>(Deceased)</font>

- **Born**: 1852-12-19, Poland
- **Affiliation**: University of Chicago, USA
- **Motivation**  
  for his optical precision instruments and the spectroscopic and metrological investigations carried out with their aid
- **Work**  
  Interference means that several light waves with the same wavelength can strengthen or cancel out one another, depending on whether they are in phase with one another. In the mid-1880s Albert Michelson developed an interferometer, which uses a semi-transparent mirror to divide up a beam of uniform light waves. After routing the different waves through different channels, the light waves are recombined, and the difference in the distances covered leads to phase displacement, which generates patterns. The instrument is used to measure lengths as well as velocities of light with great precision.

- **Born**: 1856-12-18, United Kingdom
- **Affiliation**: University of Cambridge, United Kingdom
- **Motivation**  
  in recognition of the great merits of his theoretical and experimental investigations on the conduction of electricity by gases
- **Work**  
  The idea that electricity is transmitted by a tiny particle related to the atom was first forwarded in the 1830s. In the 1890s, J.J. Thomson managed to estimate its magnitude by performing experiments with charged particles in gases. In 1897 he showed that cathode rays (radiation emitted when a voltage is applied between two metal plates inside a glass tube filled with low-pressure gas) consist of particles— electrons—that conduct electricity. Thomson also concluded that electrons are part of atoms.

  Experiments conducted in the late 19th century on cathode rays (radiation emitted when a voltage is applied between two metal plates in a glass tube filled with low-pressure gas) led to the discovery of electrons and X-rays. In crucial experiments performed by Philipp Lenard beginning in 1893, the glass tube was fitted with a thin aluminum window, making it possible to study the radiation outside the tube and thereby prove that it was not electromagnetic in nature.

- **Born**: 1842-11-12, United Kingdom
- **Affiliation**: Royal Institution of Great Britain, United Kingdom
- **Motivation**  
  for his investigations of the densities of the most important gases and for his discovery of argon in connection with these studies
- **Work**  
  The air around us consists of several different gases, mostly nitrogen gas and oxygen. Lord Rayleigh developed methods for studying the physical properties of gases in the atmosphere. When he compared nitrogen extracted from air with nitrogen extracted from chemical compounds, he found that the nitrogen from air was heavier. He concluded that the air must contain another, previously unknown substance. In 1894 he, along with William Ramsay, succeeded in extracting the previously unknown element, argon, in pure form and in analyzing its properties.

  in recognition of the extraordinary services he has rendered by his discovery of spontaneous radioactivity
- **Work**  
  When Henri Becquerel investigated the newly discovered X-rays in 1896, it led to studies of how uranium salts are affected by light. By accident, he discovered that uranium salts spontaneously emit a penetrating radiation that can be registered on a photographic plate. Further studies made it clear that this radiation was something new and not X-ray radiation: he had discovered a new phenomenon, radioactivity.
