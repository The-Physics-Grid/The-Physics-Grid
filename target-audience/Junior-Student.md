## **Fundamental acoustics**

As for fundamental acoustics, we will illustrate basic knowledge about **sounds**.

Sound is generated by the **vibration** of an object. The propagation of sound requires a **medium**, which can propagate in gases, liquids and solids, but vacuum *cannot* transmit sound. The speed of sound propagation in different substances is also different, generally the fastest in solids, followed by liquids, the slowest in gases. Moreover, the speed of propagation in the gas is also related to the temperature and pressure of the gas. Under normal circumstances, the speed of sound is about 331+0.6*Celsius m/s, and the speed of sound is about 340 m/s at room temperature (15 degrees Celsius).

In general, the longer the wavelength of the propagation of sound is, the farther the sound can travel(which seems similar to electromagnetic wave), but it is easily distorted by scattering. Conversely, sound with a short wavelength, although the energy attenuation is fast, is not easy to scatter, and can transmit sound in a straight line.

Regular sounds are called musical sounds, and irregular sounds are called noise. The shape of the propagation of a musical sound usually looks smooth and orderly, while the shape of a noise is often cluttered.  

**Loudness**, **tone**, and **timbre** are the three factors that determine the characteristics of a music.

- **Loudness** In physics, the strength of the sound that the human ear can feel is called loudness. The loudness of the sound is generally related to the amplitude of the vibration of the sound source, and the greater the vibration amplitude is, the louder the loudness is. Decibels (dB) is often used to indicate the strength of a sound.

- **Tone** In physics, the high and low levels of a sound are called tones or pitches. The pitch of the sound is generally related to the speed of the vibration of the generator, and the greater the vibration frequency of the object is, the higher the pitch is.

- **Timbre** Timbre is also called sound frets, which reflect the quality and characteristics of the sound. The timbre of the sounds emitted by different objects is different, so we can distinguish the sounds of different people speaking, the sounds of different instruments playing, and so on.

In addition, there are many sounds that cannot be heard by normal human ears. Because the frequency range of sound waves is very wide, from 10-4Hz to 1012Hz, but normal people's ears can only catch sounds between 20Hz and 20000Hz below 80 decibels (dB). Sounds above 20,000Hz are usually called **ultrasonic**, sounds below 20Hz are called **infrasonic**, and sounds between 20Hz and 20,000Hz are called **audible sounds**.

Ultrasound is widely used in life. Learning from bats, radar locates by transmitting and receiving ultrasonic waves. Doctors also use special instruments to emit ultrasound waves to break up stones in the body. Infrasound waves are often accompanied by natural disasters. It is capable of transmitting considerable distances and causing harm to the human body.Generally speaking, when normal people speak, the frequency usually falls between 150~2000HZ.

The so-called scale in music, The frequency of each octave is twice as different (the alto DO Iis about 262Hz, which is twice that of 131HZ of bass DO). Each semitone rate increases by 21/12x (about 1.0595x) in the respective scales.

## **Fundamental thermology**

As for fundamental thermology, we will explain basic knowledge about [energy](#energy), [temperature](#temperature), [heat](#heat), [power](#power) and [changes of states](#change-of-state).

### Energy

Energy (ancient Greek ἐνέργεια energeia, meaning "activity, operation") is an indirectly observed physical quantity in physics. It is often seen as the ability of one physical system to [do work](#work) on other physical systems. Since work is defined as a force acting over a distance, energy is always equivalent to the ability to block a force along a certain length.

The total energy contained in an object is based on its mass, and energy, like mass, does not come out of nothing or disappear for no reason. Energy, like mass, is a scalar quantity. In the International System of Units (SI), the unit of energy is joules, but in some fields it is customary to use other units such as "kilowatt-hours" or simply "kilowatt-hours" (i.e. one kilowatt-hour) and kilocalories and electron volts, which are also units of work.

System A can transfer energy to system B by simple transfer of matter (because the mass of matter is equivalent to energy). However, if the energy is not transferred by matter but by other means, it will cause a change in system B, because system A does work on system B. This work behaves as if a force acts at a certain distance in a system that receives energy. For example, system A can transfer (radiate) electromagnetic energy to system B, which creates a force on the particles that absorb the radiant energy. Similarly, a system may transfer energy through a collision, in which case the collided object will be subjected to a force over a distance and gain the energy of motion, which is called kinetic energy. Heat can be transferred by radiant energy or directly through the collision of particles between systems in the form of kinetic energy of microscopic particles.

In the process of all energy conversion, the total energy remains the same, because the energy of the total system is transferred between the systems, and when one system loses energy, another system must gain the lost energy, resulting in a balance between loss and gain, so the total energy does not change. This **law of conservation of energy** was proposed at the beginning of the 19th century and applied to any isolated system. According to Noether's theorem, conservation of energy is a natural consequence of the fact that the laws of physics do not change with time.

Although the total energy of a system does not change over time, the value of its energy may vary depending on the frame of reference. For example, a passenger sitting in an airplane has zero kinetic energy relative to the airplane; But relative to the Earth, kinetic energy is not zero.

In the articles of the physical sciences, there are several forms of energy that are defined. These include:

- **[Thermal energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_energy)**, the heat energy in the conduction process is called heat
- **[Chemical energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_energy)**
- **[Electrical energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_energy)**
- **[Radiant energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiant_energy)**, the energy of electromagnetic radiation
- **[Nuclear binding energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_binding_energy)**
- **[Resilience](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resilience_(materials_science))**
- **[Sound energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_energy)**
- **[Mechanical energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanical_energy)**
- **[Potential energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potential_energy)**
- **[kinetic energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinetic_energy)**
- **[Bioenergy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioenergy)**

These forms of energy can be broadly divided into two main categories: kinetic energy and potential energy. Other similar forms of energy are a mixture of kinetic energy and potential energy.

### Temperature

Temperature is a physical quantity that indicates how hot or cold an object is, and microscopically it is the intensity of the thermal motion of the molecules of an object. Temperature can only be measured indirectly by certain characteristics of an object as a function of temperature, and the scale used to measure the temperature value of an object is called a temperature scale. It specifies the starting point (zero point) of the temperature reading and the basic unit for measuring the temperature. The theoretical high pole of temperature is the [Planck temperature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck_units#Planck_temperature), while the theoretical low pole is [absolute zero](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute_zero). Both Planck temperature and absolute zero cannot be achieved in a finite number of steps. At present, the most widely used temperature scales in the world are **Celsius (°C)**, **Fahrenheit (°F)**, **thermodynamic (K)** and international practical temperature scales.

Temperature is a manifestation of the average intermolecular kinetic energy within an object. It is worth noting that a small number of molecules or even a system of molecular composition have no temperature significance due to the lack of statistical quantitative requirements.

## **Fundamental optics**

As for fundamental optics, we will illustrate basic knowledge about **light** and **lens**.

Light is an electromagnetic wave whose frequency can be captured by the human eye. It can propagate devoid of a medium, and the speed of its propagation decreases with the increase of the [density](#density) of the medium, which is opposite of sound waves. 

Light travels in a straight line. This feature is widely used in human technologies, for example, the scope of the sniper rifle is made using this principle. However, light may change its direction when it meets a different medium. There are two basic ways to change the direction of light: **[Reflection](#reflection)** and **[Refraction](#refraction)**.Light can also create an **[Image](#image)**.

### Reflection

The reflection of light can be **specular** (like a mirror) or **diffuse** (energy is retained but images are lost, but the law of reflection is still obeyed), depending on the nature of the interface.

- **Specular**  When a ray reflects on a smooth interface, it is called a specular reflection. 
![Reflection](/images/reflection.png)

    In the schematic, a beam of light PO hits a vertical mirror at point O, and the reflected light is OQ. Make an imaginary straight line perpendicular to the mirror at point O, called a **normal**. With normals, we can measure the angle of incidence i and reflection r. The law of reflection is expressed that i=r, in other words, the angle of reflection is equal to the angle of incidence, and at the same time the rays are reflected, the incident rays, the normals are in the same plane, and the reflected rays and the incident rays are divided on both sides of the normal.When incident light strikes the plane in the direction of the normal, the reflected light rays also shoot back in the direction of the normal.

    The principle of planar mirror imaging is related to the phenomenon of reflection.

    ![Mirror](/images/Mirror.png)

    Whether it is a flat mirror or a non-planar mirror (concave mirror or convex mirror), the light will obey the law of reflection and be reflected by the face mirror, and the reflected light can form vision in the retina after entering the eye.

    On a flat mirror, when a parallel beam hits the mirror, the beam is reflected in parallel, and the image is the same as what the eye sees. The image formed by the plane mirror is located where there is no actual object or light, so it forms a **[virtual image](#image)**.

- **Diffuse** When light hits the surface of a (non-metallic) material, it bounces off in all directions, either because of very small irregularities inside the material (e.g., grain boundaries of polycrystalline materials, cell or fiber boundaries of organic materials), or because of the roughness of the surface of the material, resulting in a large number of reflections. Therefore, an "image" is not formed. This is called diffuse.
    
    Most of the light that objects send to our eyes is due to diffuse reflections on their surfaces, so this is the main mechanism for our naked eye observation.

### Refraction

![refraction-in-water](/images/440px-Pencil_in_a_bowl_of_water.svg.png)

Refraction occurs when light passes through the surface of the water, such as the pencil in the picture, obliquely inserted in the water, partially under the surface of the water, then the object appears to bend at the surface of the water, because the light bends when entering the air from the water. When the light reaches the eye, the human eye thinks that he is walking in a straight line and pushes back and forth (line of sight), and the two lines of sight (the dotted line in the picture) meet higher than the actual location where the light is generated, which causes the pencil to appear taller and the water visually shallower than it actually is.

Refraction is also responsible for the rainbow and the splitting of light into color spectra after passing through the prism. Glass has a high refractive index relative to air, so when a beam of white light enters a substance from the air, its refractive index will change due to different frequencies, because different colors correspond to different frequencies, they will be refracted at different angles at the junction and thus separated, in other words, the composition of different colors in white light will be refracted at different angles, and the phenomenon of dispersion occurs.

The refractive index of air is related to its density, so it changes with air temperature and pressure. Due to the lower air pressure at high altitudes and the smaller refractive index, light refracts to the surface when traveling long distances through the atmosphere, which makes stars close to the horizon appear to be slightly offset, and allows us to see the sun first at sunrise, even if it has not risen geometrically above the horizon.Changes in temperature near the surface can lead to other optical phenomena , such as mirages or complex mirages.

### Image
Lights form images. When an image is able to be presented on a screen, it is called a **real image**. If not, it is called a **virtual image**. Real images are formed when light rays truly strike on the screen. Virtual images are formed when a reflection or a refraction changes the direction of a light, but our brain consider the direction of the light unchanged while dealing with the visual signals from the retina and form the visual image where there isn't a real item. 

### Mirror
A mirror is an item with a smooth surface and the ability to reflect light, the most common mirror is a flat mirror, often used by people to organize the appearance. In science, mirrors are also often used in telescopes, lasers, industrial instruments and other instruments.

Whether it is a flat mirror or a non-planar mirror (concave mirror or convex mirror), the light will obey the law of reflection and be reflected by the face mirror, and the reflected light can form vision in the retina after entering the eye.

On a flat mirror, when a parallel beam hits the mirror, the beam is reflected in parallel, and the image is the same as what the eye sees. The image formed by the plane mirror is located where there is no actual object or light, so it forms a virtual image.

Curved mirrors are mirrors that reflect light from curved surfaces, and are divided into convex mirrors (convex outward) and concave mirrors (sunken inward). The surface shape of most curved mirrors is part of a spherical surface, but there are also optical devices that use other shapes. The most common aspheric shape is a parabolic mirror.

- A **convex or divergent mirror** is a curved mirror that reflects light from a surface towards a light source. A collimated (parallel) beam of light is reflected by a convex mirror and diverges because the normal at each point on the mirror surface is in a different direction.

    The image is always a virtual image (light does not really pass through the image), a reduced (smaller) positive image. This feature makes convex mirrors very useful: everything on the mirror looks smaller, so the image can be "compressed" to cover a larger field of view than a flat mirror. The passenger side mirror in a car is a typical convex mirror. In some countries, these mirrors are also required to be marked with a safety warning: "The actual object is closer than seen" to alert the driving of the impact of distortion of the convex mirror on distance judgment. The optical path diagram is as follows.

## **Fundamental electromagnetics**
## **Fundamental mechanics**

As for fundamental mechanics, we will illustrate basic knowledge about [weight](#weight), [density](#density), [velocity](#velocity), forces such as [buoyancy](#buoyancy) and [friction](#friction), [Newton's three laws of motion](#newton's-three-laws-of-motion) and [work](#work). 

### Weight

Weight is the gravitational [force](#force). As a kind of force, weight is a vector quantity, which means it has both magnetude and direction.Gravity varies with **depth** and **latitude**.

**W=mg**

where W is weight, m is mass and g is the gravitational field strength. The gravitational field strength on Earth is approximately 9.8N/kg. 

When we use a balance to measure the mass of an object, the balance is actually measuring the weight but displays the mass.


### Density

Density refers to the mass per unit volume of a substance, often denoted by the Greek letter ρ or the English letter D. Mathematically, density is defined as the quotient of mass divided by volume. That is, the ratio of the mass to the volume of an object.

**ρ=m/V**

where ρ is density, m is mass, and V is volume.

The unit of density in the SI system of units is kg/m3, and other commonly used units are g/cm3, and t/m3 commonly used in engineering.

Density reflects a property of the substance itself, which can therefore be affected by external factors. Generally speaking, the main physical quantities that affect the density of substances are pressure and temperature. Gas density is significantly affected by pressure and temperature, usually the density of gas only gives standard conditions or normal temperature and pressure, and the density under other conditions can be calculated by the equation of state of the gas (such as the ideal gas equation of state or van der Waals equation). The density of a liquid depends mainly on the composition of the liquid and is less affected by temperature (but sometimes it cannot be ignored). High pressures also have a significant impact. The density of solids varies by temperature and pressure similar to that of liquids, and is generally less pronounced.

In addition, there are other physical factors that may affect the density of matter, such as magnetic fields, electric fields, etc. As a whole of nature, extreme pressures can cause the density of matter in some celestial bodies to differ greatly from the usual density.

### Velocity

Velocity is a physical quantity that describes how fast or slow an object is moving, and in what direction it is moving.

The velocity of an object is the rate of change of its position with respect to the frame of reference and is a function of time. The speed is equivalent to the specification of the object's velocity and direction of motion (e.g., 60 kilometers per hour to the north).

Velocity is a basic concept in kinematics, a branch of classical mechanics that describes the motion of an object. If the velocity, direction, or both are changed, the velocity of the object changes and it is said to be accelerating.

Velocity is a physical vector quantity; both amplitude and direction are required to define it. The absolute scalar value (magnitude) of velocity is called velocity and is a coherently derived unit whose quantity is measured in SI (metric) in meters per second (m/s) or as the SI base unit of (m⋅s-1). For example, "5 meters per second" is a scalar quantity, while "5 meters per second in the east" is a vector.

Velocity is defined as the rate of change of a position with respect to time and can also be referred to as instantaneous velocity to emphasize the difference from average velocity. The average velocity of an object over a period of time t is the ratio of its displacement r to the time interval during that time:

**v=r/t**

The instantaneous velocity of an object at a given moment is defined as the rate of change of the position vector over time:

**v=dr/dt**

The velocity of an object is usually mentioned in physics as its instantaneous velocity. The unit of speed in the International System of Units is meters per second, the international symbol is m/s, and the Chinese symbol is meters per second. In the framework of relativity, the upper limit of an object's velocity is the speed of light.

In everyday life, "velocity" and "velocity" are used interchangeably, but the two correspond to different concepts in physics: velocity is a scalar quantity (only magnitude, no direction), and its dimension is distance divided by time; Velocity is a vector quantity (with direction) and its dimension is bit removed with time. For example, if a car is traveling due north at a rate of 60 km/h, its velocity is a vector of magnitude equal to 60 km/h and pointing to true north. The instantaneous velocity of an object is equal to the magnitude of the instantaneous velocity, whereas the average velocity is not necessarily equal to the magnitude of the average velocity.

### Newton's Three Laws of Motion

- **Newton's 1st Law of Motion**

    Newton's first law of motion states that if the **external force** exerted on an object is zero, the speed of motion of the object does not change. According to this law, assuming that no external force is applied or the sum of the applied external forces is zero, then the object in motion always remains in a state of uniform linear motion, and the object at rest always remains at rest. The property exhibited by an object that maintains an unchanging state of motion is called **inertia**. Newton's first law, also known as the "law of inertia", is only established in an inertial frame of reference, also known as a "Newtonian frame of reference".

    From the first law, the following can be inferred:

    A stationary object remains stationary unless an external force is applied to it.

    An object in motion does not change its velocity unless an external force is applied to the object. Note that velocity is a vector quantity, and the magnitude and direction of the velocity of the object do not change.

    According to the first law, it is possible to determine whether there is an external force acting on the object by measuring whether the velocity of the object changes, but the first law does not give the magnitude of the external force, nor does it give the source of the external force, it only attributes the change in the velocity of the object to the exertion of the external force on the object. From another point of view, the motion of an object can only be changed because of the exertion of an external force on the object, otherwise, the motion of the object will remain the same forever, which means that the object has a certain property of laziness to change the state of motion, which is called the inertia of the object.

- **Newton's 2nd Law of Motion**

    Newton's second law of motion states that the external force experienced by an object is equal to the first derivative of momentum versus time (the first differential value). Newton's second law can also be expressed as the product of mass and acceleration when the mass of an object does not change in motion.

    Newton's second law states that the external force exerted on an object is equal to the time-varying rate of the momentum of the object:

    **F=dp/dt**
   
    where p is momentum and t is time. Since momentum is equal to mass multiplied by velocity, Newton's second law can be expressed as follows: the external force experienced by the object is equal to the product of mass and acceleration, and acceleration is in the same direction as the external force. Expressed in equations,

    **F=ma**

    where F is the external force, m is the mass, and a is the acceleration.

    According to the second law, if the mass of an object is constant, the acceleration of the object is proportional to the external force exerted, and the acceleration of the object is inversely proportional to the mass, assuming that the external force on the object is constant.

    Suppose an external force is applied to an object, since the acceleration of the object is only related to the external force and mass, in any case, the object with the same mass will exhibit the same acceleration:

    **a=F/m**

    - ***Inertial frame of reference***: To know the acceleration of an object at a certain moment, the displacement of the object as a result of time must be measured from a stationary object (or an object moving in a straight line at a uniform velocity), while the stationary object (or an object moving in a straight line with uniform velocity) must remain in motion from an inertial frame of reference if the external force is zero, which means that the entire physical system must be measured from the inertial frame of reference. Therefore, Newton's second law assumes in advance that the acceleration of an object is a numerical value measured from an inertial frame of reference.
    - ***Conservation of mass***: Classical mechanics has a hidden assumption, the conservation of mass, which is also known as Newton's zero-law of motion. Newton did not directly propose this law. The zeroth law of motion states that the mass of an object is conserved, independent of velocity, and independent of the force exerted on the object. When several objects interact, there may be a transfer of mass from one object to another, but the total mass remains the same.
    - ***Determinism***: Newton's second law is a law of determinism. Assuming that the mass, initial position, and initial velocity of an object are known quantities, Newton's second law can be applied to calculate the position and velocity of an object at any time in its trajectory from the external forces applied to it.

- **Newton's 3rd Law of Motion**

    In classical mechanics, Newton's third law of motion states that when two objects interact with each other, the forces exerted on each other are **equal in magnitude**, **opposite in direction**, and **acting on the same straight line**. The forces will inevitably appear in pairs: one of them is called the "acting force"; The other force is called "reaction force" (Latin translation of actio and reactio), also known as "resistance"; The magnitude of the two forces is equal and the direction is opposite. The distinction between them is purely arbitrary; Any force can be considered as an acting force, and its corresponding force naturally becomes a concomitant reaction force. This pairing force and reaction force is called a "pairing force". Newton's third law of motion originally described the relationship between action and reaction, i.e., action equals reaction.

    The third law is *not* a general law of nature, it only applies to certain forces, such as mental forces. Both electrostatic force and gravitational force are mental forces, so the third law can be used for mechanical analysis. Any force that involves the velocity of an object is not a mental force and cannot be analyzed using the third law, for example, the force of interaction between two moving electric charges is not a mental force, and the gravitational force of two moving objects interacting with each other is not a mental force, and the third law does not apply to these forces.

[Details](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_laws_of_motion)

### Work

Work, also called mechanical work, is a physical quantity in physics that represents the accumulation of **force** to **displacement**, and refers to the **[energy](#energy) transition** from one physical system to another, especially the transfer of energy under the action of a force that moves an object in the direction of the force. Similar to mechanical energy, work is also a scalar quantity, and the SI unit is **joules**.

Even if there is force, no work may be done. For example, in a uniform circular motion, the centripetal force does not do work because there is no change in the kinetic energy of the object doing circular motion. In the same way, a book on the table, although the table is supportive of the book, does not do work because it is not displaced.

According to the kinetic energy theorem, if an external force acts on an object to increase its kinetic energy from Ek0 to Ek, then the mechanical work done by this force is:

**W=△Ek=Ek-Ek0=½m(v²-v0²)**

where m is the mass of the object and v is the velocity of the object.

Mechanical work is the internal product of force and displacement:

**W=Fd**

If the angle between force and displacement is less than the right angle, then the mechanical work is positive, also known as the force doing positive work. If the angle between force and displacement is greater than the right angle, then the mechanical work is negative, or the force does negative work, or the object overcomes the force to do the work.

If the direction of the force is perpendicular to the direction of displacement, then this force does not do work.

## **The Origin of Natural Science**

Natural science is the science that studies organic or inorganic things and phenomena in nature. Natural sciences include astronomy, physics, chemistry, environmental science, earth science, biology, medicine, public health, dentistry, pharmacy, atmospheric science, life science, zoology, botany, agriculture, etc.

It is generally believed that the ancient Greeks Thales and Aristotle were the founders of natural science, and Galileo Galilei was the initiator of introducing experiments into natural science. Before the 18th century, natural science and philosophy in Europe were almost inseparable. Philosophers are also natural scientists, as are famous philosophers such as René Descartes, Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, and John Locke. In the early days of the development of natural science, the systematic study of natural objects or classifications was called natural history.

## **Competitions**
As for competitions, we will introduce some physics competitions suitable for junior students who are willing to improve themselves.

### The International Physics Olympiad

The International Physics Olympiad (IPhO) is a physics competition for middle school students, as a kind of international science Olympiad, the International Physics Olympiad is held once a year. The first edition was held in Warsaw, Poland in 1967.

There is one team from each country, consisting of 5 student players and 2 team leaders, and observers can also accompany the team. Students will compete individually to answer theoretical and experimental questions. Students who excel in their performance may receive gold, silver, bronze medals or honorable mentions.

The competition will be held for at least two days and five hours each. The first day consists of three theoretical questions, which must be spread across four areas taught in secondary school (mechanics, thermodynamics, electrodynamics, and quantum mechanics) for a total score of 30 points. The other day is to answer one or two experimental questions with a total score of 20 points. The questions of the competition focused on testing the creativity and understanding of physics rather than the skill and speed of mathematical calculations. There will be at least one day off between the two days. Participants must be secondary school students who have not received tertiary education and are under the age of 21 at the end of the competition. Generally speaking, the team consists of five students, one team leader and one deputy team leader.

Olympiad medals and honours are awarded according to the following rules: Gold medals are awarded to the top 8% of participants. The conditions for the silver medal are the best 25% (minus the gold medalist) of the participants. The conditions for the bronze medal are the best 50% (minus the gold and silver medalists) of the participants. The best 67% (minus the gold, silver and bronze medalists) will receive medals. All participants will receive a badge. The contestant with the highest overall score, the highest female overall score, the highest theoretical paper, and the highest experimental paper will receive a special prize.
