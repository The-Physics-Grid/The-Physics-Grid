## **Fundamental acoustics**

As for fundamental acoustics, we will illustrate basic knowledge about **sounds**.

Sound is generated by the **vibration** of an object. The propagation of sound requires a **medium**, which can propagate in gases, liquids and solids, but vacuum *cannot* transmit sound. The speed of sound propagation in different substances is also different, generally the fastest in solids, followed by liquids, the slowest in gases. Moreover, the speed of propagation in the gas is also related to the temperature and pressure of the gas. Under normal circumstances, the speed of sound is about 331+0.6*Celsius m/s, and the speed of sound is about 340 m/s at room temperature (15 degrees Celsius).

In general, the longer the wavelength of the propagation of sound is, the farther the sound can travel(which seems similar to electromagnetic wave), but it is easily distorted by scattering. Conversely, sound with a short wavelength, although the energy attenuation is fast, is not easy to scatter, and can transmit sound in a straight line.

Regular sounds are called musical sounds, and irregular sounds are called noise. The shape of the propagation of a musical sound usually looks smooth and orderly, while the shape of a noise is often cluttered.  

**Loudness**, **tone**, and **timbre** are the three factors that determine the characteristics of a music.

- **Loudness** In physics, the strength of the sound that the human ear can feel is called loudness. The loudness of the sound is generally related to the amplitude of the vibration of the sound source, and the greater the vibration amplitude is, the louder the loudness is. Decibels (dB) is often used to indicate the strength of a sound.

- **Tone** In physics, the high and low levels of a sound are called tones or pitches. The pitch of the sound is generally related to the speed of the vibration of the generator, and the greater the vibration frequency of the object is, the higher the pitch is.

- **Timbre** Timbre is also called sound frets, which reflect the quality and characteristics of the sound. The timbre of the sounds emitted by different objects is different, so we can distinguish the sounds of different people speaking, the sounds of different instruments playing, and so on.

In addition, there are many sounds that cannot be heard by normal human ears. Because the frequency range of sound waves is very wide, from 10-4Hz to 1012Hz, but normal people's ears can only catch sounds between 20Hz and 20000Hz below 80 decibels (dB). Sounds above 20,000Hz are usually called **ultrasonic**, sounds below 20Hz are called **infrasonic**, and sounds between 20Hz and 20,000Hz are called **audible sounds**.

Ultrasound is widely used in life. Learning from bats, radar locates by transmitting and receiving ultrasonic waves. Doctors also use special instruments to emit ultrasound waves to break up stones in the body. Infrasound waves are often accompanied by natural disasters. It is capable of transmitting considerable distances and causing harm to the human body.Generally speaking, when normal people speak, the frequency usually falls between 150~2000HZ.

The so-called scale in music, The frequency of each octave is twice as different (the alto DO Iis about 262Hz, which is twice that of 131HZ of bass DO). Each semitone rate increases by 21/12x (about 1.0595x) in the respective scales.

## **Fundamental theromology**



## **Fundamental optics**

As for fundamental optics, we will illustrate basic knowledge about **light** and **lens**.

Light is an electromagnetic wave whose frequency can be captured by the human eye. It can propagate devoid of a medium, and the speed of its propagation decreases with the increase of the [density](#density) of the medium, which is opposite of sound waves. 

Light travels in a straight line. This feature is widely used in human technologies, for example, the scope of the sniper rifle is made using this principle. However, light may change its direction when it meets a different medium. There are two basic ways to change the direction of light: **[Reflection](#reflection)** and **[Refraction](#refraction)**.Light can also create an **[Image](#image)**.

### Reflection

The reflection of light can be **specular** (like a mirror) or **diffuse** (energy is retained but images are lost, but the law of reflection is still obeyed), depending on the nature of the interface.

- **Specular**  When a ray reflects on a smooth interface, it is called a specular reflection. 
![Reflection](/images/reflection.png)

    In the schematic, a beam of light PO hits a vertical mirror at point O, and the reflected light is OQ. Make an imaginary straight line perpendicular to the mirror at point O, called a **normal**. With normals, we can measure the angle of incidence i and reflection r. The law of reflection is expressed that i=r, in other words, the angle of reflection is equal to the angle of incidence, and at the same time the rays are reflected, the incident rays, the normals are in the same plane, and the reflected rays and the incident rays are divided on both sides of the normal.When incident light strikes the plane in the direction of the normal, the reflected light rays also shoot back in the direction of the normal.

    The principle of planar mirror imaging is related to the phenomenon of reflection.

    ![Mirror](/images/Mirror.png)

    Whether it is a flat mirror or a non-planar mirror (concave mirror or convex mirror), the light will obey the law of reflection and be reflected by the face mirror, and the reflected light can form vision in the retina after entering the eye.

    On a flat mirror, when a parallel beam hits the mirror, the beam is reflected in parallel, and the image is the same as what the eye sees. The image formed by the plane mirror is located where there is no actual object or light, so it forms a **[virtual image](#image)**.

- **Diffuse** When light hits the surface of a (non-metallic) material, it bounces off in all directions, either because of very small irregularities inside the material (e.g., grain boundaries of polycrystalline materials, cell or fiber boundaries of organic materials), or because of the roughness of the surface of the material, resulting in a large number of reflections. Therefore, an "image" is not formed. This is called diffuse.
    
    Most of the light that objects send to our eyes is due to diffuse reflections on their surfaces, so this is the main mechanism for our naked eye observation.

### Refraction

![refraction-in-water](/images/440px-Pencil_in_a_bowl_of_water.svg.png)

Refraction occurs when light passes through the surface of the water, such as the pencil in the picture, obliquely inserted in the water, partially under the surface of the water, then the object appears to bend at the surface of the water, because the light bends when entering the air from the water. When the light reaches the eye, the human eye thinks that he is walking in a straight line and pushes back and forth (line of sight), and the two lines of sight (the dotted line in the picture) meet higher than the actual location where the light is generated, which causes the pencil to appear taller and the water visually shallower than it actually is.

Refraction is also responsible for the rainbow and the splitting of light into color spectra after passing through the prism. Glass has a high refractive index relative to air, so when a beam of white light enters a substance from the air, its refractive index will change due to different frequencies, because different colors correspond to different frequencies, they will be refracted at different angles at the junction and thus separated, in other words, the composition of different colors in white light will be refracted at different angles, and the phenomenon of dispersion occurs.

The refractive index of air is related to its density, so it changes with air temperature and pressure. Due to the lower air pressure at high altitudes and the smaller refractive index, light refracts to the surface when traveling long distances through the atmosphere, which makes stars close to the horizon appear to be slightly offset, and allows us to see the sun first at sunrise, even if it has not risen geometrically above the horizon.Changes in temperature near the surface can lead to other optical phenomena , such as mirages or complex mirages.

### Image
Lights form images. When an image is able to be presented on a screen, it is called a **real image**. If not, it is called a **virtual image**. Real images are formed when light rays truly strike on the screen. Virtual images are formed when a reflection or a refraction changes the direction of a light, but our brain consider the direction of the light unchanged while dealing with the visual signals from the retina and form the visual image where there isn't a real item. 

### Mirror
A mirror is an item with a smooth surface and the ability to reflect light, the most common mirror is a flat mirror, often used by people to organize the appearance. In science, mirrors are also often used in telescopes, lasers, industrial instruments and other instruments.

Whether it is a flat mirror or a non-planar mirror (concave mirror or convex mirror), the light will obey the law of reflection and be reflected by the face mirror, and the reflected light can form vision in the retina after entering the eye.

On a flat mirror, when a parallel beam hits the mirror, the beam is reflected in parallel, and the image is the same as what the eye sees. The image formed by the plane mirror is located where there is no actual object or light, so it forms a virtual image.

Curved mirrors are mirrors that reflect light from curved surfaces, and are divided into convex mirrors (convex outward) and concave mirrors (sunken inward). The surface shape of most curved mirrors is part of a spherical surface, but there are also optical devices that use other shapes. The most common aspheric shape is a parabolic mirror.

- A **convex or divergent mirror** is a curved mirror that reflects light from a surface towards a light source. A collimated (parallel) beam of light is reflected by a convex mirror and diverges because the normal at each point on the mirror surface is in a different direction.

    The image is always a virtual image (light does not really pass through the image), a reduced (smaller) positive image. This feature makes convex mirrors very useful: everything on the mirror looks smaller, so the image can be "compressed" to cover a larger field of view than a flat mirror. The passenger side mirror in a car is a typical convex mirror. In some countries, these mirrors are also required to be marked with a safety warning: "The actual object is closer than seen" to alert the driving of the impact of distortion of the convex mirror on distance judgment. The optical path diagram is as follows.

## **Fundamental electromagnetics**
## **Fundamental mechanics**

As for fundamental mechanics, we will illustrate basic knowledge about [weight](#weight), [density](#density), [velocity](#velocity), [forces](#force) such as [buoyancy](#buoyancy) and [friction](#friction), and [Newton's three laws of motion](#newton's-three-laws-of-motion). 

### Weight

Weight is the gravitational [force](#force). As a kind of force, weight is a vector quantity, which means it has both magnetude and direction.Gravity varies with **depth** and **latitude**.

**W=mg**

where W is weight, m is mass and g is the gravitational field strength. The gravitational field strength on Earth is approximately 9.8N/kg. 

When we use a balance to measure the mass of an object, the balance is actually measuring the weight but displays the mass.


### Density

Density refers to the mass per unit volume of a substance, often denoted by the Greek letter ρ or the English letter D. Mathematically, density is defined as the quotient of mass divided by volume. That is, the ratio of the mass to the volume of an object.

**ρ=m/V**

where ρ is density, m is mass, and V is volume.

The unit of density in the SI system of units is kg/m3, and other commonly used units are g/cm3, and t/m3 commonly used in engineering.

Density reflects a property of the substance itself, which can therefore be affected by external factors. Generally speaking, the main physical quantities that affect the density of substances are pressure and temperature. Gas density is significantly affected by pressure and temperature, usually the density of gas only gives standard conditions or normal temperature and pressure, and the density under other conditions can be calculated by the equation of state of the gas (such as the ideal gas equation of state or van der Waals equation). The density of a liquid depends mainly on the composition of the liquid and is less affected by temperature (but sometimes it cannot be ignored). High pressures also have a significant impact. The density of solids varies by temperature and pressure similar to that of liquids, and is generally less pronounced.

In addition, there are other physical factors that may affect the density of matter, such as magnetic fields, electric fields, etc. As a whole of nature, extreme pressures can cause the density of matter in some celestial bodies to differ greatly from the usual density.



## **The Origin of Natural Science**

Natural science is the science that studies organic or inorganic things and phenomena in nature. Natural sciences include astronomy, physics, chemistry, environmental science, earth science, biology, medicine, public health, dentistry, pharmacy, atmospheric science, life science, zoology, botany, agriculture, etc.

It is generally believed that the ancient Greeks Thales and Aristotle were the founders of natural science, and Galileo Galilei was the initiator of introducing experiments into natural science. Before the 18th century, natural science and philosophy in Europe were almost inseparable. Philosophers are also natural scientists, as are famous philosophers such as René Descartes, Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, and John Locke. In the early days of the development of natural science, the systematic study of natural objects or classifications was called natural history.
