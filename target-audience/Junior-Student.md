### Physics quantities and units

In physics and mathematics, a **unit** is the exact value or numerical value of a "basic physical quantity" or "basic counting benchmark" defined and adopted by convention or law as a recognized measurement standard. The given units are all artificial, often accompanied by a certain representation, such as meters, seconds, kilograms, etc., to facilitate people to have a common concept when communicating a certain quantity.

**Unit of measurement**, also known as measurement unit, is a specific general term for units, a method for humans to calculate an amount. For example, in numbers, the unit is generally "1"; when calculating length, the unit can be "nanometer", "millimeter", "centimeter", "decimeter", "meter", "kilometer", "light year", etc.; when calculating time, the unit can be "microsecond", "second", "minute", "hour", "day", "week", "month", "year", "century", etc.

In physics, **physical quantity** refers to the "properties" of matter, objects, systems, phenomena, processes, etc., which can be measured and quantified using rigorous operational (observable, measurable, and operable) definitions. There are two main types of physical quantities: **scalars** and **vectors**. Scalars are physical quantities with *magnitude but no direction*. Their symbols are usually Latin or Greek letters and are printed in italics.
Vectors are physical quantities with *magnitude and direction*, and their operations follow the axioms of vector space. The symbols of physical quantities that are vectors are bold, underlined, or with an arrow above. Scalars and vectors are the simplest **tensors** that can be used to describe more general physical quantities.

Various physical quantities have their own measurement units, and the quantity of the selected substance under specified conditions is used as the standard of the **basic measurement unit**. In different periods and different disciplines, the choice of basic quantities is different. For example, in physics, the seven physical units of time, length, mass, temperature, current intensity, luminous intensity, and amount of substance are used as **basic quantities**, also known as the **SI units**. Their units are: second, meter, kilogram, Kelvin, ampere, candela, and mole.

### Velocity

Velocity is a physical quantity that describes how fast or slow an object is moving, and in what direction it is moving.

The velocity of an object is the rate of change of its position with respect to the frame of reference and is a function of time. The speed is equivalent to the specification of the object's velocity and direction of motion (e.g., 60 kilometers per hour to the north).

Velocity is a basic concept in kinematics, a branch of classical mechanics that describes the motion of an object. If the velocity, direction, or both are changed, the velocity of the object changes and it is said to be accelerating.

Velocity is a physical vector quantity; both amplitude and direction are required to define it. The absolute scalar value (magnitude) of velocity is called velocity and is a coherently derived unit whose quantity is measured in SI (metric) in meters per second (m/s) or as the SI base unit of (m⋅s-1). For example, "5 meters per second" is a scalar quantity, while "5 meters per second in the east" is a vector.

Velocity is defined as the rate of change of a position with respect to time and can also be referred to as instantaneous velocity to emphasize the difference from average velocity. The average velocity of an object over a period of time t is the ratio of its displacement d to the time interval during that time:

$$v=\frac{x}{t}$$

The instantaneous velocity of an object at a given moment is defined as the rate of change of the position vector over time:

$$v=\frac{dx}{dt}$$

The velocity of an object is usually mentioned in physics as its instantaneous velocity. The unit of speed in the International System of Units is meters per second, the international symbol is m/s, and the Chinese symbol is meters per second. In the framework of relativity, the upper limit of an object's velocity is the speed of light.

In everyday life, "velocity" and "velocity" are used interchangeably, but the two correspond to different concepts in physics: velocity is a scalar quantity (only magnitude, no direction), and its dimension is distance divided by time; Velocity is a vector quantity (with direction) and its dimension is bit removed with time. For example, if a car is traveling due north at a rate of 60 km/h, its velocity is a vector of magnitude equal to 60 km/h and pointing to true north. The instantaneous velocity of an object is equal to the magnitude of the instantaneous velocity, whereas the average velocity is not necessarily equal to the magnitude of the average velocity.

### Acceleration


Acceleration is a physical quantity in physics, a vector quantity, mainly used in classical physics, generally represented by the letter **a**, in the International System of Units is meters per square second (m/s²). Acceleration is the rate of change of the [velocity](#velocity) vector with respect to time, describing how fast or slow the direction and magnitude of the velocity change.

In classical mechanics, [Newton's second law](#newtons-three-laws-of-motion) states that force is proportional to acceleration, also known as the "law of acceleration". Assuming that the resultant external force exerted on the object is zero, the acceleration is zero and the velocity is constant. Since momentum is the product of mass and velocity, [momentum](#momentum) is conserved at this time.

To put it simply, velocity describes how the position changes, whereas acceleration describes how the velocity changes. For example, if an object is thrown horizontally forward, its velocity is initially straight forward, but due to [weight](#weight) it begins to fall downward at the same time as it is forward, i.e. its velocity changes. Here it is mainly the gravitational acceleration due to the gravitational force of the earth that changes the velocity of the object.

Acceleration is vectorive, i.e., it needs to describe an acceleration in terms of magnitude and direction at the same time. If a force is applied to the left or right, i.e., a different acceleration is applied to an object moving forward on a smooth horizontal plane, the velocity of the object changes (including speed and direction). However, even if the speed is the same, the acceleration to the left and the acceleration to the right obviously have different effects. Similarly, the magnitude of the applied force is different, the acceleration caused by the difference is different, and the final result is also different, which can also be seen from the addition of vectors. As a vector, the superposition and decomposition of acceleration follow the parallelogram and triangle laws, respectively.

Specifically, acceleration describes the rate of change of velocity over time. It is important to note that since velocity is also a vector, the magnitude of the velocity of an object with non-zero acceleration (called speed) does not necessarily change, in fact, if the acceleration remains perpendicular to the velocity, the magnitude of the velocity does not change, while the direction changes all the time. The most common condition in life is [circular motion](#circular-motion).

The average acceleration could be represented by the following equation:

$$a=\frac{v-u}{t}$$

where a stands for average acceleration, v stands for final velocity, u stands for initial velocity and t stands for the time experienced.

The instantaneous acceleration could be represented by the following equation:

$$a=\frac{dv}{dt}$$

which is similar to the expression for instantaneous velocity. According to the equation for velocity, the instantaneous acceleration can also be expressed as the second-order derivative of displacement x:

$$a=\frac{d^2x}{dt^2}$$

Similarly, **v** and **x** can both be deduced by integrating **a(t)**.

### Weight

Weight is the gravitational [force](#force). As a kind of force, weight is a vector quantity, which means it has both magnetude and direction. Gravity varies with **depth** and **latitude**.

$$W=mg$$

where W is weight, m is mass and g is the gravitational field strength. The gravitational field strength on Earth is approximately 9.8N/kg. 

When we use a balance to measure the mass of an object, the balance is actually measuring the weight but displays the mass.

[Back to catalogue](#catalogue)

### Density

Density refers to the mass per unit volume of a substance, often denoted by the Greek letter ρ or the English letter D. Mathematically, density is defined as the quotient of mass divided by volume. That is, the ratio of the mass to the volume of an object.

$$ρ=\frac{m}{V}$$

where ρ is density, m is mass, and V is volume.

The unit of density in the SI system of units is kg/m3, and other commonly used units are g/cm3, and t/m3 commonly used in engineering.

Density reflects a property of the substance itself, which can therefore be affected by external factors. Generally speaking, the main physical quantities that affect the density of substances are pressure and temperature. Gas density is significantly affected by pressure and temperature, usually the density of gas only gives standard conditions or normal temperature and pressure, and the density under other conditions can be calculated by the equation of state of the gas (such as the ideal gas equation of state or van der Waals equation). The density of a liquid depends mainly on the composition of the liquid and is less affected by temperature (but sometimes it cannot be ignored). High pressures also have a significant impact. The density of solids varies by temperature and pressure similar to that of liquids, and is generally less pronounced.

In addition, there are other physical factors that may affect the density of matter, such as magnetic fields, electric fields, etc. As a whole of nature, extreme pressures can cause the density of matter in some celestial bodies to differ greatly from the usual density.

### Force

Force is the interaction between objects. Force can change the velocity or direction of motion of an object, or deform an object. Force is a vector quantity and has properties of magnitude and direction. According to [Newton's second law](#newtons-three-laws-of-motion), when the velocity of an object is much lower than the speed of light, the resultant force experienced by it is equal to the product of its mass and acceleration. According to the effect of force, force can be divided into thrust, pull, support and resistance; According to the nature of force, force can be divided into elastic force, gravity, friction force and electromagnetic force. The concept of force also includes the moment that changes the speed of the shaft.

Sometimes we divide all forces into two catogories: **conservative force** and **non-consevative force**.

- **Conservative force**

    If an object is acted upon by a certain force and moves from its initial position to its final position, and the [work](#work) done by this force is **independent** of the moving path, then this force is called a **conservative force**. Equivalently, if an object moves from a certain position through a closed path and then returns to its original position, then the mechanical work done by the conservative force acting on this particle is equal to zero. If all the forces acting on a physical system are conservative forces, then this physical system is called a **conservative system**.

    **Example**: [Gravitational force](#weight), [electromagnetic force](#electricity-and-magnetism).

- **Non-conservative force**

    In contrast to conservative forces, **non-conservative forces** are forces whose work is **related** to the moving path. Even if the object moves back to the origin, the total work done by the non-conservative force along the way is not zero.

    **Example**: [Friction force](#friction), [air resistance force](#falling--parachuting)

In this section, we will also introduce some theory of [elasticity](#hookes-law) and [friction](#friction).

#### **Hooke's law**

Shapes of objects can be changed by force. As for plastic objects, such as clay, they stays the same shape after the force is removed.As for elastic objects, such as string, they tend to return to their original shapes and therefore exert an elastic force against the force that changed their shapes. Hooke's law illustrates that a material resists with a force proportional to its extension or conpression before elastic limit, which is expressed as:

$$F=-kx$$

where F stands for force that changed the shape of the object, x stands for extension or compression and k stands for the spring constant, or so-called "stiffness". Since the elastic force will always be in the opposite direction of the extension of the object, there will be a negative sign.

![Force Extension Graph](/images/force_extension_graph.png)

However, there's a difference between the force-extension graph of adding force and the graph of removing the force.

![loading and unloading graph](/images/strain_33.gif)

This is because the [temperature](#temperature) of the system will increase because of the [work](#work) done to it and make it less stiff.


#### **Friction**

Friction refers to the force that hinders the relative motion of two rough objects in contact with each other or when there is a tendency to move relative to each other, and is a term in classical mechanics. Broadly speaking, objects are also subjected to frictional forces when they move in liquids and gases.

Friction occurs:

- When an object slides or is about to slide on the surface of another object, the two objects will produce a force on the contact surface that prevents the relative motion, and this force is called friction.
- Objects at rest or in motion can generate friction on the contact surface.
- The frictional force is opposite to the direction of the relative motion of the object.

Friction is related to objects rubbing against each other, so the description of friction in physics is not generalized and not as precise as other forces. In fact, it is only when one ignores friction that one can derive the fundamental laws in mechanics.

Friction comes from the adhesion between the contact surfaces of two objects, but the amount of friction has little to do with the size of the contact area.

The frictional force between solid surfaces is divided into state friction and dynamic friction. In engineering, lubricants are used to reduce friction. If two surfaces rubbing against each other are separated by a layer of liquid, then liquid friction can occur between them, and mixed friction can also occur if the liquid is not completely isolated.

- **State Friction**

    When solids do not slide against each other, the friction between the contact surfaces is called static friction, and it has a maximum value called maximum static friction. Generally speaking, the static friction is obtained by the equilibrium equation, and the maximum static friction can be described by the friction law, and it is possible to judge whether the solids slide against each other by judging the magnitude relationship between the obtained static friction and the maximum static friction.

- **Dynamic Friction**

    The dynamic friction is the kinetic friction that resists the motion of an object including moving or sliding. Due to the fact that in real life, friction always occurs since there's no surface that's absolutely smooth, a force must be applied to keep something moving. The key effect of dynamic friction is the [energy](#energy) transferring. This is the principle of drilling wood for fire. The kinetic energy of the spinning wood piece is transferred to another static piece of wood through friction and raises its temperature. The wood eventually started to burn.

### Newton's Three Laws of Motion

- **Newton's 1st Law of Motion**

    Newton's first law of motion states that if the **external force** exerted on an object is zero, the speed of motion of the object does not change. According to this law, assuming that no external force is applied or the sum of the applied external forces is zero, then the object in motion always remains in a state of uniform linear motion, and the object at rest always remains at rest. The property exhibited by an object that maintains an unchanging state of motion is called **inertia**. Newton's first law, also known as the "law of inertia", is only established in an inertial frame of reference, also known as a "Newtonian frame of reference".

    From the first law, the following can be inferred:

    A stationary object remains stationary unless an external force is applied to it.

    An object in motion does not change its velocity unless an external force is applied to the object. Note that velocity is a vector quantity, and the magnitude and direction of the velocity of the object do not change.

    According to the first law, it is possible to determine whether there is an external force acting on the object by measuring whether the velocity of the object changes, but the first law does not give the magnitude of the external force, nor does it give the source of the external force, it only attributes the change in the velocity of the object to the exertion of the external force on the object. From another point of view, the motion of an object can only be changed because of the exertion of an external force on the object, otherwise, the motion of the object will remain the same forever, which means that the object has a certain property of laziness to change the state of motion, which is called the inertia of the object.

- **Newton's 2nd Law of Motion**

    Newton's second law of motion states that the external force experienced by an object is equal to the first derivative of momentum versus time (the first differential value). Newton's second law can also be expressed as the product of mass and acceleration when the mass of an object does not change in motion.

    Newton's second law states that the external force exerted on an object is equal to the time-varying rate of the momentum of the object:

    $$F=\frac{△p}{△t}$$
   
    where p is momentum and t is time. Since momentum is equal to mass multiplied by velocity, Newton's second law can be expressed as follows: the external force experienced by the object is equal to the product of mass and acceleration, and acceleration is in the same direction as the external force. Expressed in equations,

    $$F=ma$$

    where F is the external force, m is the mass, and a is the acceleration.

    According to the second law, if the mass of an object is constant, the acceleration of the object is proportional to the external force exerted, and the acceleration of the object is inversely proportional to the mass, assuming that the external force on the object is constant.

    Suppose an external force is applied to an object, since the acceleration of the object is only related to the external force and mass, in any case, the object with the same mass will exhibit the same acceleration:

    $$a=\frac{F}{m}$$

    - ***Inertial frame of reference***: To know the acceleration of an object at a certain moment, the displacement of the object as a result of time must be measured from a stationary object (or an object moving in a straight line at a uniform velocity), while the stationary object (or an object moving in a straight line with uniform velocity) must remain in motion from an inertial frame of reference if the external force is zero, which means that the entire physical system must be measured from the inertial frame of reference. Therefore, Newton's second law assumes in advance that the acceleration of an object is a numerical value measured from an inertial frame of reference.
    - ***Conservation of mass***: Classical mechanics has a hidden assumption, the conservation of mass, which is also known as Newton's zero-law of motion. Newton did not directly propose this law. The zeroth law of motion states that the mass of an object is conserved, independent of velocity, and independent of the force exerted on the object. When several objects interact, there may be a transfer of mass from one object to another, but the total mass remains the same.
    - ***Determinism***: Newton's second law is a law of determinism. Assuming that the mass, initial position, and initial velocity of an object are known quantities, Newton's second law can be applied to calculate the position and velocity of an object at any time in its trajectory from the external forces applied to it.

- **Newton's 3rd Law of Motion**

    In classical mechanics, Newton's third law of motion states that when two objects interact with each other, the forces exerted on each other are **equal in magnitude**, **opposite in direction**, and **acting on the same straight line**. The forces will inevitably appear in pairs: one of them is called the "acting force"; The other force is called "reaction force" (Latin translation of actio and reactio), also known as "resistance"; The magnitude of the two forces is equal and the direction is opposite. The distinction between them is purely arbitrary; Any force can be considered as an acting force, and its corresponding force naturally becomes a concomitant reaction force. This pairing force and reaction force is called a "pairing force". Newton's third law of motion originally described the relationship between action and reaction, i.e., action equals reaction.

    The third law is *not* a general law of nature, it only applies to certain forces, such as mental forces. Both electrostatic force and gravitational force are mental forces, so the third law can be used for mechanical analysis. Any force that involves the velocity of an object is not a mental force and cannot be analyzed using the third law, for example, the force of interaction between two moving electric charges is not a mental force, and the gravitational force of two moving objects interacting with each other is not a mental force, and the third law does not apply to these forces.

### Falling & Parachuting

The progress of a pilot parachuting could be briefly divided into the following four stages: jumping off a plane, falling, opening a parachute and falling with it continuously. Let's see how the dynamics theories affect and determine this progress.

**Stage 1**

Immediately after the pilot started to fall, the weight of the pilot is much larger than the air resistance the pilot is experiencing. As a result, the direction of the resultant force acting on the pilot should be vertically downwards. According to [Newton's second law of motion](#newtons-three-laws-of-motion), the direction of the acceleration will also be pointing downwards. Therefore the pilot will be accelrating downwards immediately after the fall.

![stage 1](/images/stage1.jpg)


**Stage 2**

After the pilot started to fall, the speed of the falling pilot increases due to the downward acceleration. The air resistance increases as the speed increases, making the resultant force acting on the pilot become smaller and so is the acceleration. When the air resistance eventually becomes equal to the weight of the pilot, there will be no acceleration and the pilot reaches terminal velocity.

![stage 2](/images/stage2.jpg)

**Stage 3**

As soon as the pilot opens the parachute, the force of air resistance increases rapidly and the resultant force becomes vertically upward. The upward acceleration caused by the resultant force results in the decreasing falling speed of the pilot.

![stage 3](/images/stage3.jpg)

**Stage 4**

The speed of the falling pilot decreases due to the upward acceleration. The air resistance decreases as the speed decreases and finally becomes equal to the weight of the pilot again. The pilot reaches a new terminal velocity which is much smaller than the first one. The pilot is able to land safely at this speed.

![stage 4](/images/stage4.jpg)


The picture below is a velocity-time graph of the whole process.

### Circular motion

![Circular motion diagram](/images/OIP.jfif)


In physics, circular motion refers to a motion in which the trajectory is a circle or part of a circle.

Examples of circular motion are: the motion of an artificial satellite with a circular orbit, the motion of an electron perpendicular to a uniform magnetic field, and so on.

The circular motion of a particle can be decomposed in two directions: the **tangent** of the track and the **normal** of the track.

The tangential component of the acceleration of a particle is called tangential acceleration. The tangential acceleration changes the linear velocity of the particle along the orbit without changing the direction. The component of the acceleration in the normal becomes the normal acceleration. Since the normal acceleration is always directed towards the center of the circle in a circular motion, this acceleration is also known as **centripetal acceleration**. The centripetal acceleration changes the direction of the velocity of the particle and does not change the magnitude.

### Moment

[Forces](#force) that act on an object that has a fixed point may make the object rotate. Moments are the turning effect of an object. Moment could be clockwise or anti-clockwise. When more than one force acts in the same direction, their overall turning effect is just the sum of their moments.

The moment of a force is given by:

$$moment = F·d$$

where F stands for the force and d stands for the perpendicular distance from pivot. There is no official character symbol to represent moment. The usual unit for moment is the **newton-meter (Nm)**. From the formula, we can deduce that in order to make an object rotate, the farther the force is from the pivot, the less force is required. This is how **lever** structures in everyday life such as scissors, tongs, steering wheels, etc., work.

When an object is in **equilibrium**, both the resultant force and the sum of moments of it would be 0.

When forces act in a different direction, yet still balance or still in equilibrium, the total turning effect in each direction will be the same. If you consider forces and moments as vectors, as they have certain directions, the total turning effect on the balanced object would be 0. This could be represented as: 

$$sum of clockwise moments = sum of anti-clockwise moments$$

or

$$moment at point 1 + moment at point 2 = 0$$

[Back to catalogue](#catalogue)



### Momentum

Momentum could be simply considered as how difficult it is to stop a moving object. Generally speaking, the momentum of an object refers to the tendency of the object to remain in motion in the direction of its motion. Momentum is actually a corollary of [Newton's first law](#newtons-three-laws-of-motion). Momentum is a vector quantity that goes in the same direction as [velocity](#velocity). Momentum is also a conserved quantity, which is expressed as the immutability of the sum of momentum within a closed system. In classical mechanics, the conservation of momentum is implicit in Newton's laws, but it is still true in special relativity, and (generalized) momentum is also true in [electrodynamics](/branches/Electromagnesium.md), [quantum mechanics](/branches/QuantumMechanics.md), and general [relativity](/branches/Relativity.md).

When an object moves in any one frame of reference, it has momentum in that particular frame of reference. It is important to note that momentum is a reference frame determinant. That is, the same object has definite momentum in one frame of reference, but it is possible to have different momentum in another.

The value of an object's momentum depends on the value of two physical quantities: the mass and velocity of the moving object in the frame of reference.

Momentum is expressed as:

$$p=mv$$

where p stands for momentum, m stands for mass and v stands for velocity. The unit of momentum is kg·m/s.

Momentum has a special property: it remains constant as long as it is in a **closed system**, even when objects collide. Whereas, the [kinetic energy](#energy) will only be conserved in an [elastic collision](#elastic-collision). Therefore, the conservation of momentum can be used to calculate the unknown velocity after the collision.

In physics, this particular property is used to solve the problem of two objects that collide. Because momentum is always constant, the sum of momentum before the collision must be equal to the sum of momentum after the collision:

$$m₁v₁+m₂v₂=m₁v₁'+m₂v₂'$$

It is important to note that at this time v is a vector.

In general, we can calculate the velocity of an object after or before a collision by simply knowing the velocity of the object before (or after) the collision. There are two types of collisions, in both of which momentum is conserved:

- In an **elastic collision**, the kinetic energy remains constant; 

- In an **inelastic collision**, the kinetic energy is not kept constant.

#### **Elastic collision**

A good example of an elastic collision is a collision between two gas molecules in an ideal gas. When two gas molecules collide, the sum of kinetic energy and momentum before and after the collision remains the same.

#### **The law of conservation of momentum**

Momentum is a conserved quantity. The law of conservation of momentum is expressed as follows: If a system is not subjected to external forces or the sum of the external forces is zero, then the total momentum of all objects in the system remains constant. One of its corollaries is that in the absence of external force intervention, the center of mass of any system will remain in uniform linear motion or at rest. The law of conservation of momentum can be deduced from the translational symmetry of mechanical energy versus space.

In a closed system (in the absence of external forces) the total momentum will be a conserved quantity, which is implicit in [Newton's first law of motion](#newtons-three-laws-of-motion).

Because momentum is a vector quantity, after the bullet is fired from the gun that was stationary at first, although both the bullet and the gun are in motion, because the momentum of the bullet is the opposite of the momentum of the gun, they cancel each other out, so that the sum of the momentum in the system formed by the bullet and the gun is still zero.

If the net force outside the system is zero, then the interaction force of the particles in the system is also zero (which can be regarded as Newton's third law, the principle of force reaction), so the change in momentum is zero, so the momentum is conserved. 

The law of conservation of momentum is universal and applies to macroscopic and microscopic systems and reference frames.

### Work

Work, also called mechanical work, is a physical quantity in physics that represents the accumulation of **force** to **displacement**, and refers to the **[energy](#energy) transition** from one physical system to another, especially the transfer of energy under the action of a force that moves an object in the direction of the force. Similar to mechanical energy, work is also a scalar quantity, and the SI unit is **joules**.

Even if there is force, no work may be done. For example, in a uniform circular motion, the centripetal force does not do work because there is no change in the kinetic energy of the object doing circular motion. In the same way, a book on the table, although the table is supportive of the book, does not do work because it is not displaced.

According to the kinetic energy theorem, if an external force acts on an object to increase its kinetic energy from Ek0 to Ek, then the mechanical work done by this force is:

$$W=△Ek=Ek-Ek0=½m(v²-v0²)$$

where m is the mass of the object and v is the velocity of the object.

Mechanical work is the internal product of force and displacement:

$$W=Fd$$

If the angle between force and displacement is less than the right angle, then the mechanical work is positive, also known as the force doing positive work. If the angle between force and displacement is greater than the right angle, then the mechanical work is negative, or the force does negative work, or the object overcomes the force to do the work.

If the direction of the force is perpendicular to the direction of displacement, then this force does not do work.

### Power

Power is defined as the rate at which [energy](#energy) is converted or used, expressed in terms of the amount of energy per unit of time, that is, the rate at which [work](#work) is done. The international standard unit of power is the watt (W), named after James Watt, the designer of the steam engine in the 18th century. The amount of electrical energy converted into heat and light energy per unit time of the bulb can be expressed in terms of power, and the higher the wattage, the higher the capacity (or electricity) per unit time.

Energy conversion can do work, and power is also the rate at which work is done. When a person climbs a staircase with a heavy object, whether he walks up the stairs slowly or runs up the stairs quickly, the work done on the heavy object is the same, but if its power is considered, running up the stairs will do the same amount of work on the object in a shorter time, so its power is larger. The output power of an electric motor is the product of the torque generated by the motor and the angular velocity of the motor, while the forward power of the vehicle is the product of the traction force on the wheels and the speed of the vehicle.

**Formula**:

- *Average power:* 

    $$P=W/t$$

    Where P stands for power, W stands for total work done and t stands for the lasting time.

- *Mechanical power:* 

    $$P=Fv$$

    Where P stands for power, F stands for force and v stands for velocity. This formula is deduced by the formula of work done "**W=Fd**" and the formula of velocity "**v=d/t**".

- *Electrical power:* 

    $$P=VI$$
    
    Where P stands for power, V stands for voltage and I stands for current. This formula is deduced by the formula of electrical work done "**W=VIt**" and the formula of average power "**P=W/t**".

### Pressure

Pressure (symbol: p or P) is the force applied perpendicular to the surface of an object per unit area over which that force is distributed.[1]: 445  Gauge pressure (also spelled gage pressure)[a] is the pressure relative to the ambient pressure.

Various units are used to express pressure. Some of these derive from a unit of force divided by a unit of area; the SI unit of pressure, the pascal (Pa), for example, is one newton per square metre (N/m2); similarly, the pound-force per square inch (psi, symbol lbf/in2) is the traditional unit of pressure in the imperial and US customary systems. Pressure may also be expressed in terms of standard atmospheric pressure; the atmosphere (atm) is equal to this pressure, and the torr is defined as 1⁄760 of this. Manometric units such as the centimetre of water, millimetre of mercury, and inch of mercury are used to express pressures in terms of the height of column of a particular fluid in a manometer.

Pressure is the amount of force applied perpendicular to the surface of an object per unit area. The symbol for it is "p" or P.[2] The IUPAC recommendation for pressure is a lower-case p.[3] However, upper-case P is widely used. The usage of P vs p depends upon the field in which one is working, on the nearby presence of other symbols for quantities such as power and momentum, and on writing style.

**Formula**
$$p=\frac{F}{A}$$
where p is the pressure, F is the magnitude of the normal force, A is the area of the surface on contact.

**Pressure in Liquid**

Properties:

- *Increases with depth*. The deeper a liquid is, the greater the [weight](#weight) above, and so the higher the pressure. 
- *Acts in all directions*.The liquid pushes on all surfaces it is in contact with.

Formula:

$$p=ρgh$$

Where p stands for pressure, ρ stands for [density](#density), g stands for gravitational strength field and h stands for height (or depth, in the case of a liquid).

**Pressure in Gas**

Properties: 

- *Acts in all directions*. Particles in a gas move randomly around and collide with the wall of the container, exerting a pressure.
- *The air pressure decrease as you rise up through the atmosphere*. The atmosphere is denser at lower levels. At sea level, atmospheric pressure is about 105 kPa (= 105000 Pa).


![barometer](/images/barometer.jpg)

This is a mercury barometer.It is the first measuring apparatus of the air pressure. The mercury column gets higher as the surrounding air pressure increase. At sea level, 760mm of mercury can be supported.

## **Thermal physics**

### Energy

Energy (ancient Greek ἐνέργεια energeia, meaning "activity, operation") is an indirectly observed physical quantity in physics. It is often seen as the ability of one physical system to [do work](#work) on other physical systems. Since work is defined as a force acting over a distance, energy is always equivalent to the ability to block a force along a certain length.

The total energy contained in an object is based on its mass, and energy, like mass, does not come out of nothing or disappear for no reason. Energy, like mass, is a scalar quantity. In the International System of Units (SI), the unit of energy is joules, but in some fields it is customary to use other units such as "kilowatt-hours" or simply "kilowatt-hours" (i.e. one kilowatt-hour) and kilocalories and electron volts, which are also units of work.

System A can transfer energy to system B by simple transfer of matter (because the mass of matter is equivalent to energy). However, if the energy is not transferred by matter but by other means, it will cause a change in system B, because system A does work on system B. This work behaves as if a force acts at a certain distance in a system that receives energy. For example, system A can transfer (radiate) electromagnetic energy to system B, which creates a force on the particles that absorb the radiant energy. Similarly, a system may transfer energy through a collision, in which case the collided object will be subjected to a force over a distance and gain the energy of motion, which is called kinetic energy. Heat can be transferred by radiant energy or directly through the collision of particles between systems in the form of kinetic energy of microscopic particles.

In the process of all energy conversion, the total energy remains the same, because the energy of the total system is transferred between the systems, and when one system loses energy, another system must gain the lost energy, resulting in a balance between loss and gain, so the total energy does not change. This **law of conservation of energy** was proposed at the beginning of the 19th century and applied to any isolated system. According to Noether's theorem, conservation of energy is a natural consequence of the fact that the laws of physics do not change with time.

Although the total energy of a system does not change over time, the value of its energy may vary depending on the frame of reference. For example, a passenger sitting in an airplane has zero kinetic energy relative to the airplane; But relative to the Earth, kinetic energy is not zero.

In the articles of the physical sciences, there are several forms of energy that are defined. These include:

- **[Thermal energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_energy)**, the heat energy in the conduction process is called heat
- **[Chemical energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_energy)**
- **[Electrical energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_energy)**
- **[Radiant energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiant_energy)**, the energy of electromagnetic radiation
- **[Nuclear binding energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_binding_energy)**
- **[Resilience](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resilience_(materials_science))**
- **[Sound energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_energy)**
- **[Mechanical energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanical_energy)**
- **[Potential energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potential_energy)**
- **[Kinetic energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinetic_energy)**
- **[Bioenergy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioenergy)**

These forms of energy can be broadly divided into two main categories: kinetic energy and potential energy. Other similar forms of energy are a mixture of kinetic energy and potential energy.

### Temperature

Temperature is a physical quantity that indicates how hot or cold an object is, and microscopically it is the intensity of the thermal motion of the molecules of an object. Temperature can only be measured indirectly by certain characteristics of an object as a function of temperature, and the scale used to measure the temperature value of an object is called a temperature scale. It specifies the starting point (zero point) of the temperature reading and the basic unit for measuring the temperature. The theoretical high pole of temperature is the [Planck temperature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck_units#Planck_temperature), while the theoretical low pole is [absolute zero](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute_zero). Both Planck temperature and absolute zero cannot be achieved in a finite number of steps. At present, the most widely used temperature scales in the world are **Celsius (°C)**, **Fahrenheit (°F)**, **thermodynamic (K)** and international practical temperature scales.

Temperature is a manifestation of the average intermolecular kinetic energy within an object. It is worth noting that a small number of molecules or even a system of molecular composition have no temperature significance due to the lack of statistical quantitative requirements.

As for gas, temperature is directly proportional to its [pressure](#pressure) when the volume is constant and inversely proportional to its volume when the pressure is constant.

### Thermal expansion

Most substances expand when they are heated, this is called thermal expansion. We already know that thermometer is designed based on the thermal expansionary properties of liquid. Let's look at some other examples of use of expansion in our daily lives.

- **Rivets** are used in shipbuilding and other industries to join metal plates. The red hot rivet is passed through holes in two metal plates and then hammered until the ends are rounded. As the rivet cools, it contracts and pulls the two plates tightly together.

![Rivets](/images/riveting-process-illustration.png)

- **Bimetallic strips** are made of two metals joined firmly together and are designed to bend as it gets hot. One metal expands more rapidly than the other when being heated, therefore cause the strip to bend. These are used in devices such as fire alarms and thermostats.

![Bimetallic strips](/images/Bimetallic_strips_operation_F1.webp)

Gases expand when they are heated, just like solids and liquids. When the gas is heated, its particles move faster and push with greater force on its surroundings, for example, the walls of the gas container. When the volume of the gas is conserved, the pressure it exerts will be directly proportional to the temperature change and vice versa. When the temperature is conserved, the pressure and volume of the gas are inversely proportional to each other. This is indicated by the **ideal gas formula**:

$$pV=nRT$$

Where P stands for pressure, V stands for volume, n stands for moles number of the gas, R stands for ideal gas constant and T stands for temperature (K).

### Heat and heat transfer

In thermodynamics, heat is the thermal energy transferred between systems due to a [temperature](#temperature) difference.In colloquial use, heat sometimes refers to thermal energy itself. Thermal energy is the kinetic energy of vibrating and colliding atoms in a substance.

*The difference between heat and temperature*: Temperature is a measure of energy while heat is the transferring quantity of energy.

As a form of energy, heat has the unit joule (J) in the International System of Units (SI). In addition, many applied branches of engineering use other, traditional units, such as the British thermal unit (BTU) and the calorie. The standard unit for the rate of heating (the so-called [power](#power)) is the watt (W), defined as one joule per second.

The symbol Q for heat was introduced by Rudolf Clausius and Macquorn Rankine in 1859.

There are three ways to transfer heat:

- **Heat conduction**: The transfer of vibrational energy from one molecule to another, transferring heat energy from high to low temperatures. The thermal conductivity of various materials is different, and the good conductivity performance, such as metal, also includes the movement of free electrons, so the heat transfer speed is fast, and it can be used as a heat exchanger material; Those with poor conductivity, such as asbestos, can be used as thermal insulating materials.
- **Heat convection**: refers to the heat transfer process caused by the relative displacement between the various parts of the fluid caused by the macroscopic movement of the fluid, and the mixing of hot and cold fluids. The difference in density of the system due to different temperatures is the cause of convection. Convective conduction is faster than direct conduction because it involves the kinetic process.
- **Heat radiation**: It is the amount of heat dissipated directly through electromagnetic wave radiation, and the conduction velocity depends on the absolute temperature of the heat source, the higher the temperature, the stronger the radiation.

According to the way of heat transfer and process requirements, heat exchangers are designed, and almost all kinds of chemical industries have heat exchange processes, which require various heat exchangers.

### Change of states

The state of matter, often referred to as the state of matter, refers to the appearance of different phases of a substance. In the early days, the state of matter was distinguished by its volumetric properties. In the **solid** state, matter has a fixed shape and capacity; Whereas, in the **liquid** state, the substance maintains a fixed capacity but the shape changes with the shape of the container; In the **gaseous** state, the substance expands for diffusion with or without capacity. Recently, scientists have classified molecules by their interrelationships. Solid state means that molecules only *vibrate* in a fixed position because of their mutual suction. In the case of liquids, the distance between the molecules is still relatively close, and there is still a certain attraction between the molecules, so they can only move in a limited range. As for in the gaseous state, the distance between the molecules is farther, so the force of attraction between the molecules is not significant, so the molecules can move at will. The plasma state is a highly ionized gas that appears at high temperatures. However, since the suction force between each other is an ionic force, it has different properties from gases, so the plasma state is considered to be the fourth state of matter. If there is a state of matter that is not composed of molecules but of different forces, we consider a new state of matter. For example: Fermi coagulation and quark-gluon pulp.

![change-of-states](/images/changesofstates.jpg)

This is a diagram of changes of state. 

During the changes of states, the substance usually remains at a **constant temperature**. This is because the particles absorb heat to break down the bonds or release heat to rebuild the bonds. During these progresses, energy is not used to change the temperature. 

**Evaporation**, which is not mentioned in the diagram, is an exception. Different from boiling, evaporation occurs on the surface of a liquid at any temperature. The energetic paticles on the surface of a liquid move through the substance so rapidly that they overcome the attraction between molecules and escape into the air and form the gaseous state. These particles bring most of the energy away so the liquid will cool down if it's not heated. 

***Ways to increase the rate of evaporation:***
- **Heating**. Heating up a liquid can increase the kinetic energy of the particles on the surface and help them overcome the attraction sooner.
- **Increase the area of the surface**. Therefore there will be a larger space for evaporation to occur.
- **Add a draught**. The flowing draught could take away the particles that have just evaporated, preventing them from condensing again to liquid and leaving a larger space for new evaporated particles.

### Latent Heat 

The latent heat capacity refers to the amount of energy needed to completely change the state or phase of 1kg of the substance without changing its temperature, for example, the amount of energy 1kg of ice absorbed to completely melt is the latent heat capacity of ice or water. The unit of latent heat capacity is J/kg.

**Formula**:

$$Q=mL$$

Where Q represents energy needed, m represents mass and L represents specific latent heat (we use the word "specific" to mean that it relates to unit mass, which is 1kg).

This equation can be used for both fusion (melting) and vaporisarion (boiling). Note that this equation tells us that the energy must be continuously supplied when the substance has already been heated to its melting or boiling point.

[Back to catalogue](#catalogue)

### Specific Thermal Capacity

The specific thermal capacity (or so-called SHC) of a substance is the amount of energy needed to change the temperature of 1kg of the substance by 1℃. The unit of specific heat capacity is J/(kg*℃) or J/(kg*K).

**Formula**:

$$Q=cm△t$$

Where Q represents energy needed, m represents mass，c represents SHC and △t represents temperature changed. Both degrees celcius and kelvin are allowed to be the unit of the temperature changed.

*Some frequently-used SHCs:*

**Water**: 4181 J/(kg*℃) (We usually estimate it to 4200 during calculations.)

**Oxygen**: 918 J/(kg*℃)

Lead: 128 J/(kg*℃)

As a common substance with a relatively great specific heat capacity, water is often used in absorb, store and release heat progresses, for example, water inside a heater is heated then tranferred into the room to release the thermal energy stored in it. After most of the thermal energy is released and the water becomes cool, it is transferred away to heat up again and newly heated water will enter the room to build a circulating heating system.

## **Waves**

### Wave property

Wave refers to the propagation of vibrations. For example, water waves are formed by vibrations of the water surface, or the water particles. More 'physically', it refers to the motion formed when a perturbation or vibration of a certain physical quantity is transmitted point by point in space. Wave can transfer energy or information, but cannot transfer matter. 

To refer to the back and forth moments of the wave, we use the term '**oscillation**'.

Here are some **properties** you could use to identify a wave: 

- **Frequency**: The number of waves passing any point in one second. **(f/Hz)**

- **Period**: The time taken for one oscillation. **(T/s)**

- **Wavelength**: The distance between any 2 corresponding points on the wave. **(λ/m)**

- **Amplitude**: The maximum displacement of a wave from its rest point. **(A/m)**

There are two types of wave, **transverse** wave and **longitudinal** wave.

- **Transverse wave**

    The direction of vibration of particles in a transverse wave is perpendicular to the direction of propagation of energy. The point where the particle is at its highest point of vibration is called a **crest** and the point where it is at the lowest point of vibration is called a **trough**, as the diagram below shows.

    ![Transverse wave](/images/transversewave-205474523.webp)

    The most known example of transverse wave is the [light](#light). In fact, all electromagnetic waves are transverse waves.

- **Longitudinal wave**

    The direction of vibration of particles in a transverse wave is parallel to the direction of propagation of energy. The point where the particles are the most dense is called a **compression** and the point where the particles are the least dense is called a **rarefaction**, as the diagram below shows.

    ![Longitudinal wave](/images/62908-004-6E7798B5.webp)

    The most known example of longitudinal wave is the [sound](#sound). 

There are two formulae of waves that you might need to remember: 

$$f=\frac{1}{T}$$

where f refers to frequency and T refers to period. This is easy to understand according to their definitions.

$$v=λf$$

where v refers to the speed of wave propagation, λ refers to wavelength and f refers to frequency. This is also easy to understand since frequency could be considered as "1/time" according to the first formula and wavelength could be considered as distance, therefore "v=λf" is transferred into "v=s/t", which we already learned in the section of [velocity](#velocity).

[Back to catalogue](#catalogue)

### Sound

**Sound** is generated by the **vibration** of an object. The propagation of sound requires a **medium**, which can propagate in gases, liquids and solids, but vacuum *cannot* transmit sound. The speed of sound propagation in different substances is also different, generally the fastest in solids, followed by liquids, the slowest in gases. Moreover, the speed of propagation in the gas is also related to the temperature and pressure of the gas. Under normal circumstances, the speed of sound is about 331+0.6*Celsius m/s, and the speed of sound is about 340 m/s at room temperature (15 degrees Celsius).

In general, the longer the wavelength of the propagation of sound is, the farther the sound can travel(which seems similar to electromagnetic wave), but it is easily distorted by scattering. Conversely, sound with a short wavelength, although the energy attenuation is fast, is not easy to scatter, and can transmit sound in a straight line.

Regular sounds are called musical sounds, and irregular sounds are called noise. The shape of the propagation of a musical sound usually looks smooth and orderly, while the shape of a noise is often cluttered.  

**Loudness**, **tone**, and **timbre** are the three factors that determine the characteristics of a music.

- **Loudness** In physics, the strength of the sound that the human ear can feel is called loudness. The loudness of the sound is generally related to the amplitude of the vibration of the sound source, and the greater the vibration amplitude is, the louder the loudness is. Decibels (dB) is often used to indicate the strength of a sound.

- **Tone** In physics, the high and low levels of a sound are called tones or pitches. The pitch of the sound is generally related to the speed of the vibration of the generator, and the greater the vibration frequency of the object is, the higher the pitch is.

- **Timbre** Timbre is also called sound frets, which reflect the quality and characteristics of the sound. The timbre of the sounds emitted by different objects is different, so we can distinguish the sounds of different people speaking, the sounds of different instruments playing, and so on.

In addition, there are many sounds that cannot be heard by normal human ears. Because the frequency range of sound waves is very wide, from 10-4Hz to 1012Hz, but normal people's ears can only catch sounds between 20Hz and 20000Hz below 80 decibels (dB). Sounds above 20,000Hz are usually called **ultrasonic**, sounds below 20Hz are called **infrasonic**, and sounds between 20Hz and 20,000Hz are called **audible sounds**.

Ultrasound is widely used in life. Learning from bats, radar locates by transmitting and receiving ultrasonic waves. Doctors also use special instruments to emit ultrasound waves to break up stones in the body. Infrasound waves are often accompanied by natural disasters. It is capable of transmitting considerable distances and causing harm to the human body.Generally speaking, when normal people speak, the frequency usually falls between 150~2000HZ.

The so-called scale in music, The frequency of each octave is twice as different (the alto DO Iis about 262Hz, which is twice that of 131HZ of bass DO). Each semitone rate increases by 21/12x (about 1.0595x) in the respective scales.

### Electromagnetic waves

**Electromagnetic waves** refer to [electric](#electric-field) and [magnetic](#magnetic-field) fields that oscillate in phase and are perpendicular to each other. They are **non-mechanical waves** that transfer energy and momentum in the form of waves in space, and their propagation direction is **perpendicular** to the oscillation direction of the electric and magnetic fields.

Electromagnetic waves do **not** need to rely on a medium to propagate, and their propagation speed in a vacuum is the **speed of light**, represented by letter **c**. Electromagnetic waves can be classified according to [frequency](#wave-property), from low frequency to high frequency, mainly including **radio waves**, **microwaves**, **infrared rays**, **visible light**, **ultraviolet rays**, **X-rays** and **gamma rays**. The higher the frequency, the more energy the wave can carry, but the shorter distance it can travel.

Electromagnetic waves that can be received by the human eye have a wavelength of approximately 380 to 780nm, which is called visible light.

[Back to catalogue](#catalogue)


### Light

**Light** is an **electromagnetic wave** whose frequency can be captured by the human eye. It can propagate devoid of a medium, and the speed of its propagation decreases with the increase of the [density](#density) of the medium, which is opposite of sound waves. 

Light travels in a straight line. This feature is widely used in human technologies, for example, the scope of the sniper rifle is made using this principle. However, light may change its direction when it meets a different medium. There are three basic ways to change the propagation of light waves: **[Reflection](#reflection)** , **[Refraction](#refraction)** and **[Diffraction](#diffraction)**.Light can also create an **[Image](#image)**.

[Back to catalogue](#catalogue)

### Image
Lights form images. When an image is able to be presented on a screen, it is called a **real image**. If not, it is called a **virtual image**. Real images are formed when light rays truly strike on the screen. Virtual images are formed when a reflection or a refraction changes the direction of a light, but our brain consider the direction of the light unchanged while dealing with the visual signals from the retina and form the visual image where there isn't a real item. 

[Back to catalogue](#catalogue)

### Reflection

The reflection of light can be **specular** (like a mirror) or **diffuse** (energy is retained but images are lost, but the law of reflection is still obeyed), depending on the nature of the interface.

- **Specular**  When a ray reflects on a smooth interface, it is called a specular reflection. 
![Reflection](/images/reflection.png)

    In the schematic, a beam of light PO hits a vertical mirror at point O, and the reflected light is OQ. Make an imaginary straight line perpendicular to the mirror at point O, called a **normal**. With normals, we can measure the angle of incidence i and reflection r. The law of reflection is expressed that i=r, in other words, the angle of reflection is equal to the angle of incidence, and at the same time the rays are reflected, the incident rays, the normals are in the same plane, and the reflected rays and the incident rays are divided on both sides of the normal.When incident light strikes the plane in the direction of the normal, the reflected light rays also shoot back in the direction of the normal.

    The principle of planar mirror imaging is related to the phenomenon of reflection.

    ![Mirror](/images/Mirror.png)

    Whether it is a flat mirror or a non-planar mirror (concave mirror or convex mirror), the light will obey the law of reflection and be reflected by the face mirror, and the reflected light can form vision in the retina after entering the eye.

    On a flat mirror, when a parallel beam hits the mirror, the beam is reflected in parallel, and the image is the same as what the eye sees. The image formed by the plane mirror is located where there is no actual object or light, so it forms a **[virtual image](#image)**.

- **Diffuse** When light hits the surface of a (non-metallic) material, it bounces off in all directions, either because of very small irregularities inside the material (e.g., grain boundaries of polycrystalline materials, cell or fiber boundaries of organic materials), or because of the roughness of the surface of the material, resulting in a large number of reflections. Therefore, an "image" is not formed. This is called diffuse.
    
    Most of the light that objects send to our eyes is due to diffuse reflections on their surfaces, so this is the main mechanism for our naked eye observation.

[Back to catalogue](#catalogue)

### Refraction

![refraction-in-water](/images/440px-Pencil_in_a_bowl_of_water.svg.png)

Refraction occurs when light passes through the surface of the water, such as the pencil in the picture, obliquely inserted in the water, partially under the surface of the water, then the object appears to bend at the surface of the water, because the light bends when entering the air from the water. When the light reaches the eye, the human eye thinks that he is walking in a straight line and pushes back and forth (line of sight), and the two lines of sight (the dotted line in the picture) meet higher than the actual location where the light is generated, which causes the pencil to appear taller and the water visually shallower than it actually is.

Refraction is also responsible for the rainbow and the splitting of light into color spectra after passing through the prism. Glass has a high refractive index relative to air, so when a beam of white light enters a substance from the air, its refractive index will change due to different frequencies, because different colors correspond to different frequencies, they will be refracted at different angles at the junction and thus separated, in other words, the composition of different colors in white light will be refracted at different angles, and the phenomenon of dispersion occurs.

The refractive index of air is related to its density, so it changes with air temperature and pressure. Due to the lower air pressure at high altitudes and the smaller refractive index, light refracts to the surface when traveling long distances through the atmosphere, which makes stars close to the horizon appear to be slightly offset, and allows us to see the sun first at sunrise, even if it has not risen geometrically above the horizon.Changes in temperature near the surface can lead to other optical phenomena , such as mirages or complex mirages.

#### **Dispersion**

In optics, dispersion is the phenomenon in which the phase velocity of a light wave changes with frequency. We refer to media with this property as dispersive medium.

Although the term dispersion is used in the field of optics to describe light waves and other electromagnetic waves, the same sense of "dispersion" applies to any type of wave. In optics, the main phenomenon of dispersion is that different colors of light produce a spectrum due to different refractive angles when passing through a **prism** or a lens with chromatic aberration.

![Dispersion of white light while passing through a prism](/images/R.png)

This is a diagram of dispersion of white light while passing through a prism.

#### **Lens**

A lens is an optical device that **aggregates** or **disperses** light through **refraction**, usually made of a piece of glass, but similar devices used for other electromagnetic radiation are also commonly called lenses, such as: microwave lenses made of paraffin, magnifying glasses made of transparent materials such as glass, resin, plastic, or crystal, glasses, etc., are also lenses.

There are two types of lenses, the one with a thick middle and a thin edge is called a **convex lens**, the one with a thin middle and a thick edge is called a **concave lens**, the lens with a much smaller radius than the spherical surface is called a thin lens, and the geometric center of a thin lens is called the mirror center of the lens.

Lenses are classified according to the curvature of two optical surfaces, and the two sides of a biconvex lens (or convex lens) are protruding, in other words, a lens with both sides is depressed is called a biconcave lens (concave lens). If one surface is flat, this lens is called a plano-convex lens or plano-concave lens and is determined by the curvature of the other surface. One surface of the lens is convex and the other surface is concave, which is called a convex and concave lens, crescent lens. (Generally, crescent lenses refer to all forms of convex and concave lenses.) 

The straight line passing through the center of the two faces of the lens is called the main optical axis of the lens, referred to as the main axis or optical axis; The center of the lens is called the center of light.

- **Convex lens**

    If the lens is a biconvex lens or plano-convex lens, a calibrated or parallel beam of light travels parallel to the optical axis through a point behind the lens that converges (or focuses) the lens on the axis, this point is called the focal point, and the distance from the lens is called the focal length. Since the convex lens concentrates light, it can be used to start a fire. In addition, many devices are equipped with convex lenses to create a magnified image of the object.

    ![Convex lens aggregating light](/images/Lens1.svg.png)

- **Concave lens**

    If the lens is a biconcave or plano-concave lens, a calibrated or parallel beam of light that passes through the mirror in a direction parallel to the optical axis will spread (or diverge) behind the lens. The light that diverges after passing through appears to be emitted from a point on the optical axis in front of the lens, which is called the focal point, and the distance from the lens is called the focal length. In contrast to a positive lens, its focal length is negative. Because concave lenses can diverge light, their imaging is smaller and their field of view is wider, and they are often used to make myopia glasses.

    ![Concave lens dispersing light](/images/Lens1b.svg.png)

The distance from the object to the optical center of the lens is called the object distance, and the distance from the image formed by the object through the lens to the optical center of the lens is called the image distance. Then the imaging of convex and concave lenses satisfies the following formula:

$$\frac{1}{u} + \frac{1}{v} = \frac{1}{v}$$

where u stands for the object distance, v stands for the image distance and f stands for the focal length. 

The specific rules of the imaging of the convex lens and the imaging of the concave lens by the virtual object are as follows:

![diagram of convex lens forming images](/images/2018928-164950811-4736-image-formed-by-the-convex-lens-for-various-positions-of-the-object.png)

 If not otherwise specified, the imaging of the convex lens is a real image, and the imaging of the concave lens is a virtual image.

### Diffraction

Diffraction is a physical phenomenon in which a wave travels in a straight line when it encounters an obstacle. In the right cases, any wave has the intrinsic property of diffraction.

In classical physics, waves undergo varying degrees of bending propagation after passing through obstacles such as slits, holes, or disks. Suppose an obstacle is placed between the light source and the observation screen, there will be bright and dark areas on the observation screen, and the boundaries of these areas are not sharp, it is a complex pattern of light and dark. This phenomenon is called diffraction, and it can occur when a wave encounters an obstacle in its path.

In addition to this, a similar effect occurs when light waves pass through a medium with an inhomogeneous refractive index, or when a sound wave passes through a medium with an inhomogeneous acoustic impedance. Under certain conditions, not only water waves and light waves can produce diffraction phenomena visible to the naked eye, but also other types of electromagnetic waves (such as X-rays and radio waves) can also be diffracted by the naked eye.

### Mirror
A mirror is an item with a smooth surface and the ability to reflect light, the most common mirror is a flat mirror, often used by people to organize the appearance. In science, mirrors are also often used in telescopes, lasers, industrial instruments and other instruments.

Whether it is a flat mirror or a non-planar mirror (concave mirror or convex mirror), the light will obey the law of reflection and be reflected by the face mirror, and the reflected light can form vision in the retina after entering the eye.

On a flat mirror, when a parallel beam hits the mirror, the beam is reflected in parallel, and the image is the same as what the eye sees. The image formed by the plane mirror is located where there is no actual object or light, so it forms a virtual image.

Curved mirrors are mirrors that reflect light from curved surfaces, and are divided into convex mirrors (convex outward) and concave mirrors (sunken inward). The surface shape of most curved mirrors is part of a spherical surface, but there are also optical devices that use other shapes. The most common aspheric shape is a parabolic mirror.

- A **convex or divergent mirror** is a curved mirror that reflects light from a surface towards a light source. A collimated (parallel) beam of light is reflected by a convex mirror and diverges because the normal at each point on the mirror surface is in a different direction.

    The image is always a virtual image (light does not really pass through the image), a reduced (smaller) positive image. This feature makes convex mirrors very useful: everything on the mirror looks smaller, so the image can be "compressed" to cover a larger field of view than a flat mirror. The passenger side mirror in a car is a typical convex mirror. In some countries, these mirrors are also required to be marked with a safety warning: "The actual object is closer than seen" to alert the driving of the impact of distortion of the convex mirror on distance judgment. The optical path diagram is as follows.

## **Electricity and magnetism**

### Charge

There are two kinds of charges, positive charge (carried by a proton or a metal ion, represented by **"+"**) and negative charge (usually carried by an electron, represented by **"-"**). Only negative charges can move through out the electrical conductor, but both charges can be induced on objects. The number of positive and negative charges in the universe are approximately equal and cancels each other out. 

**RULE**: Same charges **repel**, opposite charges **attract**. The attracting or repeling forces between electric charges are called the **electric force** which decreases as their separation increases. 

Charge is measured in **coulombs** (C) and is defined in terms of the ampere. The charge on an electron e = 1.6*$10^{-19}$ C.

A **conductor** can conduct electricity whereas an **insulator** cannot. In an insulator all electrons are bound firmly to their atoms; in a conductor some electrons can move freely from atom to atom. All metals are good conductors. 

[Back to catalogue](#catalogue)  

### Static electricity

Static electricity is a phenomenon caused by the unbalanced distribution of **electric charge** in a material system. Objects can be charged by rubbing amber with fur or glass rods with silk. Once an object is charged, the charge will remain on the object unless it is removed by other objects, so it is called "static electricity". Static electricity is different from electric current, which is an electrical phenomenon caused by the directional movement of electric charge in a conductor. Charged objects often have the property of attracting light and small objects (such as paper scraps). 

The most common cause of static electricity is **[friction](#friction)**. It causes electrons to be transferred from one neutral material to the other. The number of negative charges the material that gains electrons contains exceeds the number of positive charges on it, therefore it becomes negatively charged. The number of positive charges the material that loses electrons contains exceeds the number of negative charges on it, therefore it becomes positively charged. 

An insulator can be charged by rubbing because the charge produced cannot move from where the rubbing occurs, i.e. the electric charge is *static*. A conductor will become charged only if it is held with an insulating handle, otherwise electrons are transferred between the conductor and the ground via the person's body. 

An **electroscope** tells if something contains static electricity or charges, usually consisting of a pair of thin gold leaves suspended from an electrical conductor that leads to the outside of an insulating container.

![electroscope](/images/2.png)

As the diagram shows, when a negatively charged object approaches the top of the electrocope, negative charges carried on the electrons will be repelled to the bottom leaves; same charges on the leaves also repels each other so they separate. When a positively charged object approaches the top of the electroscope, negative charges will be attracted to the top, leaving the bottom leaves to be both positive, therefore they will also separated due to the repelling forces. *The electroscope does not tell the type of the charge.*

It is important to know that when the top of the electroscope is contacting with the charged conductor, the electrons will flow from the electroscope to the object if the object is positive, or from the object to the electroscope if the object is negative. The results of leaves separating will be the same as inducing.

### Electric field

The **electric field** is a region of space where an electric charge experiences a force due to its charge. It is a physical field that exists around electric charges and can transmit the interaction between charges. There is always an electric field around an electric charge; at the same time, the electric field exerts a force on other charges in the field. The field observed when the observer is stationary relative to the charge is called the electrostatic field. If the charge moves relative to the observer, in addition to the electrostatic field, a magnetic field appears. In addition to electric charges, magnetic fields that change over time can also generate electric fields. This type of electric field is called a vortex electric field or an induced electric field.

The **electric force** is the force exerted on a charge when it is placed in an electric field. Or it is the force exerted on a free charge moving in an electric field.

In any electric field, the field strength at each point has a certain direction. Based on this, a series of curves can be drawn in the electric field so that the direction of the tangent at each point on the curve is consistent with the direction of the field strength at that point. These lines are called **electric field lines**. The electric field lines are marked with arrows, indicating the positive direction that the tangent at each point on the line should take (that is, the direction of the field strength at that point). Using the electric field lines, the direction of the field strength at each point it passes through can be determined, and thus the direction of the electric field force on the positive charge placed at that point can be indicated. However, it should be noted that, in general, the electric field lines are not the orbits along which the positive charge moves under the action of the electric field force. This is because the direction of charge movement (that is, the direction of velocity) is not necessarily in the direction of the force.

The density of electric field lines at any point in the electric field is numerically equal to the magnitude of the field strength at that point. In areas with high density, the electric field lines are dense, indicating that the field strength at that point is strong; in areas with low density, the electric field lines are sparse, indicating that the field strength at that point is weak.

Here are some examples of how electric field lines are drawn:

![Positive charge field](/images/VFPt_plus_thumb.svg.png)

The electric field generated by a **positive** charge is inversely proportional to the square of the distance and is directed **outward**.

![Negative charge field](/images/VFPt_minus_thumb.svg.png)

The electric field generated by a **negative** charge is inversely proportional to the square of the distance and is directed **inward**.

Any electric field line in an electrostatic field starts from a positive charge (or comes from infinity) and ends at a negative charge (or extends to infinity). 

![When two charges approach](/images/VFPt_charges_plus_minus_thumb.svg.png)

The electric field lines drawn according to the above regulations have two properties:

- Because the electric field lines of the electrostatic field indicate the direction of the field strength, any electric field line in the electrostatic field starts from the positive charge (or comes from infinity) and ends at the negative charge (or extends to infinity). They will **not be interrupted** in places where there is no charge, and **will not form a closed loop**.

- Because there is only one definite field strength direction at any point in the electrostatic field (except where the point charge is located), any two electric field lines **cannot intersect**.

### Electric current

An electric current consists of **moving electric charges**. Electric current is the average directional movement of electric charge in an electric field or (semiconductor). The direction of electric current is defined as the direction of movement of **positive charge**; the magnitude of electric current is called **current intensity**, which refers to the net amount of charge transferred through a certain cross section of the wire per unit time, and the unit is **ampere**(A). The direction of electric current is defined as the same as the direction that positive charges move in a circuit, but in reality it is not positive charges that move, but negative charges. **Electron flow** is the movement of free electrons (negative charges) in a circuit in the opposite direction of the electric current.

The amount of charge passing through 1 coulomb per second is called 1 ampere. "Current intensity" is often simply referred to as "current" or "current amount". The formula used to calculate current intensity is shown below:

$$I=\frac{Q}{t}$$

where I stands for current intensity, Q stands for amount of charges and t stands for the time for charges to pass through. Ampere is one of the seven [basic units](#physics-quantities-and-units) of the International System of Units. An ammeter is an instrument specifically used to measure electric current.

An electric current has three **effects** that reveals in its existence:

- **Heating and lighting**

    The electric current does [work](#work) when it goes through the wire and creates [heat](#heat-and-heat-transfer). When the wire that carries it gets hot enough, it will start to glow and produce light. This is the basic working principle of a filament light.

- **Magnetic**

    The wire carrying a current produces a [magnetic field](#magnetic-field) around it. The direction of the field is indicated by the diagram below. 

    ![Induced magnetic field from a wire](/images/下载.png)

    This is the basic working principle of an [electromagnet](#electromagnet).

- **Chemical**

    Electrolysis is the process of passing an electric current through an electrolyte solution or molten substance to cause redox reactions at the cathode and anode. Electrolysis occurs when an electrochemical cell is subjected to an applied [voltage](#electric-potential) (i.e., the charging process).

**Alternating current** (AC) and **direct current** (DC) are two different types of electrical signals. Alternating current originally refers to current with periodic positive and negative changes. Direct current originally refers to current with a fixed direction. However, in addition to describing current, alternating current and direct current are also often used to describe voltage.

### Electric potential

In electrostatics, **electric potential** (ePtntl) is a physical scalar quantity that describes the energy level at a point in an electric field, and its unit is **volt** (V). The difference in the potential at either sides of the component is the **potential difference** or the **voltage** across the component. The electric work is done by potential difference, not by using up electrons. Voltage is also the measure of the amount of energy provided to each coulomb of charge to move it past a point in the current. The total energy provided by the battery per unit charge is called the **electromotive force** or the **EMF** of the battery. However, the EMF of a battery is not always equal to the potential difference across the battery since most batteries has internal [resistance](#resistance) that requires energy to push electrons through it, too. 

Here is a formula to calculate the electric potential: 

$$V=\frac{E}{Q}$$

where V stands for voltage, E stands for energy or total work done and Q stands for the charge.

[Back to catalogue](#catalogue)  

### Electrical circuit

An **electrical circuit**, also known as a power line, electrical loop, or loop, is a network of closed loops that provides a return path for [electric current](#electric-current). A circuit is generally composed of **circuit components** connected in a specific way by **wires**, and must have *at least one closed path*. 

A circuit consists of three basic parts: **power supply**, **load** and **intermediate links**: "power supply" is a device that generates electrical energy by creating a [potential](#electric-potential) difference; "load" is a device that converts electrical energy into mechanical energy, light energy, thermal energy, etc.; wires are the "intermediate links" connecting the power supply and load, and play the role of transmitting and distributing electrical energy.

#### **Circuit diagram**

A **circuit diagram** is a simplified graphical representation of an electrical circuit. It is a type of schematic. A circuit diagram uses simple pictorial representations of the circuit, with straight lines representing wires and circuit symbols connecting each other. 

Here are some examples of basic circuit diagram symbols.

![Circuit diagram symbols](/images/circuit%20diagram%20symbols.gif)

Usually, if wires are connected together, we draw a dot on the circuit diagram where they connect; if wires simply cross over each other, we won't draw a dot.

**Connection method of circuit components**:

- **Series circuit:**

    A *single* circuit with power supply. One end of the power supply is connected to the head of a component, and the tail of this component is connected to the head of another component, thus forming a single closed circuit.

    ![Series](/images/series.png)

    When the components are connected in series, the [current](#electric-current), [voltage](#electric-potential) and [resistance](#resistance) in the circuit follow the rules below:

    1. The amount of current passing through every component is the same, which is also equal to the total current in the circuit.

        **I=I₁=I₂=I₃=...**

    2. The voltage across all circuit components adds up to the supply voltage, or the EMF of the battery. The voltage across each component is directly proportional to its resistance.

        **V=V₁+V₂+V₃+...**

    3. The resistance of all circuit components adds up to the total resistance of the circuit.

        **R=R₁+R₂+R₃+...**

- **Parallel circuit:**

    A circuit in which one end of two or more components is connected to one place, and the other end is also connected to another place. This connection is called parallel connection.

    ![Parallel](/images/parallel.png)

    When the components are connected in parallel, the [current](#electric-current), [voltage](#electric-potential) and [resistance](#resistance) in the circuit follow the rules below:

    1. The amount of current passing through all circuit components adds up to the total amount of current in the circuit. The amount of current passing through each component is inversely proportional to its resistance.

         **I=I₁+I₂+I₃+...**

    2. The voltage across every component is the same, which is also equal to the EMF of the power supply in this case above.

         **V=V₁=V₂=V₃=...**

    3. The reciprocal of the resistance of all the components adds up to the reciprocal of the total resistance of the circuit. 

        **1/R=1/R₁+1/R₂+1/R₃+...**

### Resistance

In electromagnetism, **resistance** is the ability of an object to oppose the flow of electric current. It is usually represented by capital letter **R**, and the unit of resistance is **ohm** (Ω). Conductors have low resistance and can carry electric current very efficiently. These materials are often used to make electrical wires. **Resistors** are circuit components with a specific resistance. They can be made from a variety of materials. 

**Resistivity** is a physical quantity that describes the **conductivity** of a material. It is numerically equal to the conductivity of a certain material per unit length and unit cross-section. Resistivity is independent of factors such as the length and cross-sectional area of ​​the conductor. It is the *electrical property* of the material itself, determined by the material of the conductor, and is often related to **temperature**.The unit of resistivity in the International System of Units is **Ω·m**, pronounced as **ohm-meter**. Resistivity is usually represented by **ρ**.

The resistance of an object can be calculated using the **Resistance Law**, which is the **defining formula** of resistance:

$$R=ρ\frac{L}{A}$$

where R stands for resistance of the object, ρ stands for the resistivity of its material, L stands for its length and A stands for its cross-sectional area. We can deduce from the formula that, an object's resistance is directly proportional to the resistivity and length, and inversely proportional to the cross-sectional area.

We can figure out the resistance of a resistor connecting in a circuit by using **Ohm's Law**.

$$R=\frac{V}{I}$$

where R stands for resistance, V stands for electric potential difference across the component and I stands for the current passing through it. This formula indicates that with fixed potential difference across, the current intensity will be inversely proportional to the resistance in the current. This formula is applicable to **pure resistance circuits**, that is, when there are only resistance elements and the resistance value is constant.

Besides the normal resistors with fixed resistances, there are also some other kinds of resistors that are commonly used in a circuit. 

- **Variable resistor** 

    The resistance of variable resistors can be changed by human, therefore we will be able to control the current in the circuit due to Ohm's Law. 

    ![Variable resistor](/images/variable%20resistor.png)

- **Thermistor**

    The resistance of a thermistor is inversely proportional to the temperature, allowing the circuit to vary automatically according to the temperature change.

    ![Thermistor](/images/thermistor.png)

- **Light dependent resistor**

     The resistance of a thermistor is inversely proportional to the light intensity, allowing the circuit to vary automatically according to the change of light.

     ![Light dependent resistor](/images/Lightdependent.png)

- **Diode**

    Diodes are very special. They allow current to pass only in one direction. If the current is passing in the correct direction, diodes have as low resistance as the wires; if the current is passing in the wrong direction, diodes have an incredibly large resistance that almost blocks the current.

    ![Diode](/images/diode.png)

[Back to catalogue](#catalogue)  

### Ammeter and voltmeter

- **Ammeter**

    **Ammeter**, also known as amperemeter, is an instrument for measuring [current](#electric-current). The main types include rotating coil ammeter, rotating iron sheet ammeter, thermocouple ammeter, hot wire ammeter and clamp ammeter.

    Here is the circuit diagram symbol for an ammeter.

    ![ammeter](/images/ammeter.png)

    In order to measure the current passing through a component, the ammeter should be connected with the component in **series**. The resistance of an ammeter is very small and you can ignore it in normal calculations and consider it as wire.

- **Voltmeter**

    A **voltmeter** is a device used in electromagnetism to measure voltage in volts. The voltmeter is usually connected in **parallel** to the circuit element that is measuring the voltage. The resistance of the voltmeter is usually large to avoid changing the voltage being measured and you can consider it as a circuit breaker where no current can pass through.

    Here is the circuit diagram symbol for a voltmeter.

    ![voltmeter](/images/voltmeter.png)

Here is a circuit diagram of measuring the resistance of a resistor using the ammeter and the voltmeter.

![Measuring resistance](/images/measuring%20resistance.jpg)

The voltmeter is connected in parallel with the resistor R and the power supply E, which means it is measuring the potential difference across both of the components at the same time. The ammeter is measuring both the current passing through R and the current passing through the voltmeter. However, the resistance of the voltmeter is too large that according to Ohm's Law, the current passing through it could be ignored, therefore the current passing through R is measured. 

After taking the two measurements, the resistance of R could be figured out by substituting the measured values ​​into the Ohm's law formula: **R=V/I**. This is the most fundamental method to measure the resistance of a component.

[Back to catalogue](#catalogue)  

### Electric work and power

When [current](#electric-current) passes through a conductor, [heat](#heat-and-heat-transfer) is generated. Electric energy is transferred into thermal energy, therefore we say that the current or the electric energy does [work](#work). **Joule's law** or **Joule-Lenz law** is a law that quantifies the conversion of electrical energy into heat energy by conducting an electric current. 

The formula is shown below:

$$Q=I²Rt$$

where Q stands for heat produced, I stands for current intensity, R stands for resistance of the component that is producing heat and t stands for the time current is passing through.

Using **[Ohm's law](#resistance)**, we can deduce another two forms of formulae:

$$Q=VIt$$

$$Q=\frac{V²}{R}t$$

Because Ohm's law is used in the derivation process, these derivation formulae is only applicable to **pure resistance circuits** like Ohm's law.

**Electric power** refers to the ability of electric energy to do work. The operational definition is the work done by electric current per unit time, or the electric energy transferred or converted per unit time. It can be used to represent the power consumption capacity of electrical equipment (the physical quantity of how fast or slow it consumes electric energy), the power generation capacity of power generation equipment, and the power transmission capacity of power transmission and transformation equipment. Electric power is represented by the letter P, and the unit is Watt, and the symbol is W.

Using the work and [power](#power) formula **W=P/t** and the formulae of Joule's law aforesaid, we can deduce the formulae to calculate electric power.

$$P=I²R$$

$$P=VI$$

$$P=\frac{V²}{R}$$

When using these formulae, the components must be linear, that is, the circuit must obey Ohm's law.

### Magnet

A **magnet**, or lodestone, is an object that can attract iron and generate a [magnetic field](#magnetic-field) outside it. In a narrow sense, a magnet refers to a product made of magnetite ore, while in a broad sense, a magnet refers to an object or device used to generate a magnetic field. Magnets can attract ferromagnetic materials, such as metals such as iron, nickel and cobalt. The determination of magnetic poles is to suspend a magnet with a thin wire. The magnetic pole pointing to the north is called the **north pole** or **N pole**, and the magnetic pole pointing to the south is called the **south pole** or **S pole**. (If the earth, which possesses a gigantic magnetic field, is thought of as a large magnet, the current geomagnetic north pole of the earth is the S pole, and the geomagnetic south pole is the N pole.) Magnets with opposite poles **attract** each other, and with the same poles **repel** each other. That is, the south pole attracts the north pole, the south pole repels the south pole, and the north pole repels the north pole.

Magnets are divided into **permanent magnets** and **non-permanent magnets**. Natural permanent magnets are also called natural magnets. Permanent magnets can also be artificially made (the strongest magnet is a neodymium magnet). Non-permanent magnets are magnetic only under certain conditions, usually in the form of [electromagnets](#electromagnet), that is, using electric current to strengthen their magnetic field.

If a **ferromagnetic material** (material that can be magnetised) is placed inside a magnetic field or an electric field, it will form a magnet. If the material loses magnetism as soon as the field is removed, it is called "**soft**". If it remains magnetic after the field is removed, it is called "**hard**". 

To demagnetise a magnet made of hard material, we can use the methods below:

1. Put the magnet in a solenoid and use an [AC current](#electric-current) which will constantly change the direction of north and south of the magnetic field. Slowly pull the magnet out. As the magnet is removed the field strength will be slowly decreasing, removing the magnetism.

2. Heat the magnet beyond a temperature known as the **curie temperature**. The magnet will lose all magnetism.

3. Hit it with a hammer. The vibrational effects along the lines of the molecular/metallic bonds are similar to heating.

The magnetic molecules (according to the molecular magnet theory) inside the unmagnetized magnet are arranged irregularly. After the magnetization process, the magnetic molecules will be arranged regularly. At this time, the N pole and S pole of the magnetic molecule will face the same direction, making the magnet magnetic and becoming a magnet. At the same time, there are two opposite poles on the same magnet and the magnetism of the two poles is **equal**.

### Magnetic field

A **magnetic field** is a **vector field** that describes the magnetic effects on moving charges, currents, and magnetic materials (iron, steel, etc.).  Charges moving in a magnetic field are subject to forces perpendicular to their own velocity and to the magnetic field.

In electromagnetism, magnets, currents, and time-varying electric fields all produce magnetic fields. Magnetic materials or currents in a magnetic field feel the **magnetic force** due to the magnetic field, thus showing the existence of a magnetic field. A magnetic field is a vector field; it has a *direction* and *magnitude* at any position in space.

Magnets exert **forces** and **torques** on each other through the magnetic fields they generate. Moving charges also produce magnetic fields.

Similar to electric field lines, we use magnetic field lines to represent a magnetic field. The magnetic field lines start off from the north pole of a magnet and goes to the south pole. They never cross each other and are always continuous. Magnetic field also exists inside the magnet, therefore the field lines will go through the magnet itself, though we don't usually draw that part on diagrams. The direction of the magnetic field lines is same as the direction of the north pole of a small compass when it's placed on a certain point in the magnetic field.

Here are some examples of magnetic field lines indication from [circuitbread](https://www.circuitbread.com/textbooks/introduction-to-electricity-magnetism-and-circuits/magnetic-forces-and-fields/magnetic-fields-and-lines).

![Magnetic field lines](/images/magnetic-field-lines.jpg)

We could see that when two like poles face each other, there is a neutral point in the center between two poles.

Some times we might be dealing with a magnetic field that is perpendicular to the plane of the paper. Here is how we indicate this kind of magnetic field using vector symbols.

![Vector symbol](/images/in%20and%20out%20of%20paper.png)

When the magnetic field line is pointing perpendicularly towards the paper, we indicate it using an "**x**" like the symbol on the left. When the magnetic field line is pointing perpendicularly out from the paper, we indicate it using an "**·**" like the symbol on the right.

### Electromagnet

An **electromagnet** is a device that uses electric current to generate magnetic force. It is an indispensable tool in a society with widespread electricity. It is a **non-permanent** magnet. When [direct current](#electric-current) passes through a conductor, a [magnetic field](#magnetic-field) is generated. When it passes through a conductor that is made into a **solenoid**, a magnetic field similar to a bar magnet is generated. If a ferromagnetic material is added to the center of the solenoid, the magnetic material will be **magnetized**, thereby achieving the effect of strengthening the magnetic field.

Generally speaking, the magnetic field strength generated by an electromagnet is related to the **intensity of the direct current**, the **number of coil turns**, and the **magnetic conductive material** in the center. The larger the current and the more coil turns, the stronger the magnetic field generated.

![Electromagnet](/images/electromagnet.jpg)

The electromagnet was invented because a wire carrying current can generate a **magnetic field**. We use the **right-hand rule** or the **Ampere's law** to determine the direction of the magnetic field around a wire.

- In a **straight** conductor (Ampere's law one): 

    Hold the conductor in your right hand, with your thumb pointing in the direction of the current in the straight conductor. The direction of the magnetic field around the conductor is then indicated by your four fingers. 

    ![Right hand rule 1](/images/righthand2.png)
    
    *In this diagram, the magnetic field is represented by letter B.*

- In a **solenoid** (Ampere's law two): 

    Hold the solenoid in your right hand, with your four fingers pointing in the direction of the current. The end pointed by your thumb is the N pole of the solenoid or the electromagnet formed.

    ![Right hand rule 2](/images/righthand1.png)

Electromagnets are widely used in many electrical installations. Here are some examples:

- **Reed relay**

    ![Reed relay](/images/reedrelay.webp)

    As the figure shows, **reed relay** is an electric component that acts similar to an automatic switch. When the voltage across it is small, the metal chips are seperated and the switch is off. When the voltage is large enough, the ends of the metal chips will be magnetised and attract each other, therefore touching and switch is on. This component allows people to switch a circuit with extremely large current and voltage by switching a small circuit with relatively small current and voltage, thus avoiding the risk of electric shock.

- **Electric bell**

    ![Electric bell](/images/electricbell.jpg)

    When the switch of the **electric bell** is turned on, the electromagnet in the circuit generates magnetism and attracts the metal strip. The metal strip is attracted and moves closer to the electromagnet and hits the sonorous. The deformation of the metal strip causes it to shrink back and leave the sonorous due to [elastic force](#hookes-law). This process repeats, so the sonorous is constantly being hit and the electric bell keeps making sounds until the switch is turned off.

### Ampere's force

**Ampere's force** is the force that a **current-carrying** conductor experiences when it enters an **external magnetic field** in certain angle. This is because the conductor itself possesses a magnetic field when current is passing through it, and this induced magnetic field will interact with the external magnetic field to produce magnetic force. The conductor will *only* experience a force if the current in it is **not parallel** to the direction of the [magnetic field lines](#magnetic-field). It will receive the maximum force when the current is perpendicular to the magnetic field lines. The direction of the force is perpendicular to the plane formed by the magnetic field lines and the current.

![Ampere's Force](/images/AmpereFroce.jpg)

To determine the direction of the Ampere's force, we can use the **left-hand rule**. Spread your hand and make your thumb perpendicular to the four other fingers. Point the four fingers towards the direction of the current and let magnetic field lines penetrate your hand perpendicularly as the diagram shows. The direction indicated by your thumb will be the direction of the Ampere's force on the conductor.

***Note:** When we say "direction of the current", we are talking about the **conventional current**, which is the direction of the movement of **positive charges**. If you are working on an single electron entering the magnetic field, remember to point your four fingers at an opposite direction.*

To reverse the direction of Ampere's force, we can either reverse the direction of the **magnetic field** or the direction of the **current**. If both are reversed, the direction of Ampere's force remains unchanged.

In case of a single **charged particle** in the magnetic field, its motion will be slightly different from a current-carrying conductor. Ampere's force is always perpendicular to the direction of the current, which, in this case, is the direction of the particle's movement. This will cause the charged particle to keep changing its moving direction and eventually commit [circular motion](#circular-motion), with Ampere's force acting as its centripetal force that provides it with centripetal acceleration.

![Charged particle in a magnetic field](/images/chargeinMF.png)

The diagram above shows the circular motion of a positively charged particle in a magnetic field. In the diagram, v is the initial velocity of the charge, R is the radius of its circular trajectory, B is the magnetic field and F is the Ampere's force. 

***Note:** When we say that charged particles commit circular motion in the magnetic field, it does not indicate that the trajectory of the particle must be a complete circle. It could possibly exit the magnetic field before it has a chance to finish the circle.*

### Motor

The effect of [Ampere's force](#amperes-force) could be used to convert electrical energy into mechanical energy, which is what an **electric motor** does. A **DC motor** is an electric motor driven by [direct current](#electric-current).

![DC Motor 1](/images/DCmotor.png)

![DC Motor 2](/images/dcmotor2.png)

In a DC motor, the current-carrying rotor coils which are placed between two permanent magnets experience a **[turning effect](#moment)** since the position of the shaft is fixed. The direction of current is opposite on opposite sides of the coil because current is essentially running in and out, therefore forces act in opposite directions on each side of the coil, causing a turning effect. The greater the force on the coil, the faster it will turn. In order to increase the spinning speed of the motor, a large number of coils are used at the same time.

The coil is connected to the **split-ring-commutator**. The cell or the power supply is connected to the **brushes**. When the DC motor is operating, the split-ring-commutator spins with the coil, but the brushes and the rest of the circuit stays still. The circuit is completed when the metal ring touches the brush and broken when the carbon brush is aligned with the gap between the metal ring parts. This makes the coil still receive a force that causes it to continue rotating in the current direction after rotating 180 degrees, because after the two contact points of the coil and the power supply are exchanged, the current does not reverse macroscopically.

The direction of rotation of the coil in the DC motor can be changed by reversing the positive and negative poles of the power supply or reversing the north and south poles of the stator magnets.

### Electromagnetic induction

**Electromagnetic induction** refers to the fact that a conductor placed in a changing [magnetic field](#magnetic-field) or a conductor moving in the magnetic field will generate an [electromotive force](#electric-potential). This electromotive force is called **induced electromotive force**. If the conductor is closed into a loop, the electromotive force will drive electrons to flow, forming an **induced [current](#electric-current)**. British physicist **Michael Faraday** discovered the phenomenon of electromagnetic induction in 1831.

In general, whenever there is **relative movement** between the conductor and the magnetic field, an emf will be induced. The movement of the conductor shall not be parallel to the magnetic field lines. In other words, the conductor should be **cutting** the magnetic field lines.

In order to detect the induced current or the induced emf, we can use [ammeter or voltmeter](#ammeter-and-voltmeter).

![Electromagnetic induction](/images/electromagneticInduction.png)

To determine the direction of the induced current, we can use the **right-hand rule**. Spread your hand and make your thumb perpendicular to the four other fingers. Point the thumb towards the direction of the movement of the conductor and let magnetic field lines penetrate your hand perpendicularly as the diagram shows. The direction indicated by your four fingers will be the direction of the induced current in the conductor.

![Right hand rule](/images/righthandrule.png)

### Lenz's law

You may realize that the left-hand rule is *symmetrical* to the right-hand rule. This indicates that whenever a conductor creates relative movement with a magnetic field, the induced current will interact with the magnetic field and the [Ampere's force](#amperes-force) will act in the direction that hinders the movement of the conductor. This is further explained by **Lenz's law**.

In electromagnetism, Lenz's law can find the direction of the electromotive force and induced current generated by [electromagnetic induction](#electromagnetic-induction). For the [non-conservative forces](#force) involved in electromagnetic induction, this law can be regarded as an extension of the law of conservation of energy. Lenz's law was discovered by Russian physicist **Heinrich Lenz** in 1834 and states:

> The direction of the induced current generated by the change of magnetic flux is the direction that *resists* the change of magnetic flux.

It is not easy to determine the direction of the induced current using only Faraday's law of electromagnetic induction. Lenz's law provides a simple and intuitive way to find the direction of the induced current.

### AC generator

An **AC generator**, or an alternator, converts mechanical energy into electrical energy in the form of [alternating current](#electric-current) using [electromagnetic induction](#electromagnetic-induction). It generates an alternating [emf](#electric-potential) which therefore causes current to flow in the connected circuit. 

![AC generator](/images/ACgenerator.png)

Similar to the DC motor, AC generator also has two **stator magnets** that are used to create the [magnetic field](#magnetic-field) needed and a coil spinning between the poles of the magnets. Instead of spilt-ring commutators used in a DC motor, AC generator makes use of **slip rings** and brushes that are connected to an external circuit. 

The rotating coil cuts the magnetic field consistently as it rotates and allows an induced current to flow in it. The slip rings and the brushes connect the coil with the external circuit so the induced current provided in the coil could flow into the external circuit and be used by components, in this case the light bulb. The current induced changes direction everytime the coil rotates over 180°, therefore an **alternating current** is generated. A maximum emf is induced when the motion of the coil is perpendicular to the magnetic field. which is, when the position of the coil is horizontal.

The magnitude of the induced current could be increased by increasing the **frequency** of rotation, the **number of turns** in the coil and the **strength of the magnet**. Also, inserting a **soft iron core** into the coil could effectively increase the magnitude of current produced.

[Back to catalogue](#catalogue)

### Transformer

A **transformer** is a device that changes the size of an **alternating** [voltage](#electric-potential) or [current](#electric-current). Its working principle is similar to the AC generator.

![Transformer](/images/Basic-E-I-transofrmer-diagram-1024x732.png)

As the diagram indicates, a basic transformer consists of a **primary coil**, a **secondary coil** and a **transformer core** which is usually made of **soft iron** since it's an easily-magnetised material. The coils are wound on the transformer core. Current from the power source is called the **primary current** (I₁) and runs in the primary coil, whereas the current induced or the current output, which is called the **secondary current** (I₂), runs in the secondary coil. The potential difference across the primary coil is the **primary voltage** (V₁) which is equal to the voltage provided by the power supply. A **secondary voltage** (V₂) is induced across the secondary coil and output as the transformed voltage. 

First, an **alternating current** is supplied to the primary coil by an external power supply. The current is continuously changing direction, therefore the magnetic field it produces around the iron core is also changing. The changing field is passed through the iron core and results in a changing magnetic field around the secondary coil. This will induce an **emf** across the secondary coil, therefore create an output voltage. As the magnetic field is continuously changing, the output voltage and current will also be alternating with the same frequency as the input current. 

The number of turns in each coil depends on the type of the transformer: **step-up** or **step-down**.

- **Step-up**

    A **step-up** transformer **increases** the voltage of the input power (V₁ < V₂). It has more turns in the secondary coil than in the primary coil (n₁ < n₂).

- **Step-down**

    A **step-down** transformer **decreases** the voltage of the input power (V₁ > V₂). It has less turns in the secondary coil than in the primary coil (n₁ > n₂).

Here are some equations used to calculate quantities involved in a transformer: 

$$\frac{V₁}{V₂}=\frac{N₁}{N₂}$$

where V₁ stands for primary voltage, V₂ stands for secondary voltage, N₁ stands for number of turns in the primary coil and N₂ stands for number of turns in the secondary coil.

$$I₁V₁=I₂V₂$$

where I₁ stands for primary current and I₂ stands for secondary current. This equation is only suitable for **ideal transformers**, which are transformers with 100% efficiency and the input power is equal to the output power. This is impossible in the reality since there is always energy loss.

## **Nuclear physics**

### Atom

**Atoms** are the **smallest units** of common matter that make up chemical elements; atoms are also the smallest particles in chemical changes and the smallest units of the chemical properties of elements.

An atom contains a dense **nucleus** and a number of negatively charged **electrons** surrounding the nucleus. The nucleus of an **anti-atom** is negatively charged, and the surrounding anti-electrons are "positively charged", but we will not be discussing anti-atoms in this section. The nucleus of a positive atom is composed of positively charged **protons** and electrically neutral **neutrons**. When the number of protons and electrons is the same, the atom is electrically neutral and is called a **neutral atom**; otherwise, it is an **ion** with a positive or negative charge.

Depending on the number of protons and neutrons, the type of atom is different: the number of protons determines which element the atom belongs to, and the number of neutrons determines which isotope of this element the atom is.

Because most of the mass of an atom is made up of the masses of protons and neutrons, the sum of the number of protons and neutrons is called the **mass number** or the **nucleon number**. The mass of a stable atom at rest is usually expressed in terms of the **unified atomic mass unit** (u), also known as the **Dalton** (Da). This unit is defined as one-twelfth the mass of electrically neutral carbon 12, which is approximately 1.6605565×$10^{-27}$ kg. The mass is so small that scientists also have difficulty working with it directly, so they usually use another unit, the **mole**, or mol for short. The definition of a mole is that for any element, there is always the same number of atoms in one mole, which is about **6.022×$10^{23}$**. If the atomic mass of an element is 1u, then one mole of that atom has a mass of 0.001kg, or 1 gram. For example, the atomic mass of carbon is 12u, so one mole of carbon has a mass of 0.012kg.

[Back to catalogue](#catalogue)

### Nucleus

The **nucleus** is a component of an [atom](#atom), located in the center of the atom, and occupies most of the mass of it. The nucleus is composed of **neutrons** and **protons**. Protons are particles with one unit of positive charge, whereas neutrons are neutral particles with no charge at all. When there are electrons around it in the same number as the protons, it forms an atom. The nucleus is extremely small, and its volume accounts for only a few hundred billionths of the volume of the atom. However, about 99.95% of the mass of the atom is concentrated in this tiny nucleus.

The [energy](#energy) that binds protons and neutrons in the nucleus is called **binding energy**. Generally speaking, the binding energy is the highest for elements with atomic weights between 58 and 62. As far as we know, elements with atomic weights less than 62 will undergo **nuclear fusion** reactions to release energy, while elements with atomic weights greater than 62 will undergo **nuclear fission** reactions to release energy.

In order to undergo **nuclear fusion** reaction, nuclei need to collide with each other, which requires a very high relative speed between the nuclei as they have to overcome the strong repelling force between them due to their same [charge](#charge). However, heavy nuclei could undergo **nuclear fission** automatically since the nucleus of the element cannot hold the excessive protons and neutrons for a long time. When an element has an **unstable** nucleus, it will tend to **decay** into other more stable element and release [ionizing radiation](#radiation) at the same time. These elements are called the **radioactive element**.

[Back to catalogue](#catalogue)


### Radiation

In physics, **radiation** refers to the transmission of [energy](#energy) in the form of [waves](#waves) or subatomic particles moving in a vacuum or medium. Radiation can be divided into **ionizing radiation** and **non-ionizing radiation**. In this section, we will introduce three most typical types of ionizing radiation.

![Penetration](/images/penetration.jpg)

- **Alpha(α) particles** 

    ![Alpha-radiation](/images/Alpha_Decay.svg.png)

    An **alpha particle** (also called an **alpha ray** or **alpha radiation**) is a particle composed of two protons and two neutrons, the same as the nucleus of helium-4. Alpha particles is positively charged with two units (+2), therefore they will deflect when entering an [electric field](#electric-field). Alpha particles are produced when an unstable nucleus holds too many protons and neutrons and has to release some of the protons and neutrons to attain a more stable energy level.

    Due to its two positive charges, alpha particles are very **ionizing**, meaning that they have a strong tendancy and ability to attract electrons. This makes them extremely harmful to living creatures, as they damage the structure of cells by robbing the elctrons and even cause mutation. However, it is easy to stop an alpha ray as it does not possess a strong penetrating power. As the diagram above shows, only a thin layer of paper is needed to block the alpha ray. 

- **Beta(β) particles**

    ![Beta-radiation](/images/Beta-minus_Decay.svg.png)

    **Beta particles** (also called **beta rays** or **beta radiation**) are high-energy, high-speed **electrons** or **positrons** emitted from the nucleus during beta decay. In this section we will only discuss the circumstance of emitting electrons, which is the beta particle. Beta particles possess a negative charge (-1), therefore they will also deflect in an electric field, but in different directions comparing to alpha particles. Beta particles are produced when a neutron in a nucleus changes itself into a proton and an electron.

    Due to its one negative charge, beta particles are also **ionizing** but not as damaging as alpha particles. However, it has a stronger penetrating power, and is hindered by few mms of aluminium. 

- **Gamma(γ) rays**

    ![Gamma-radiation](/images/Gamma_Decay.svg.png)

    **Gamma rays** (also called **gamma radiation**) are [electromagnetic waves](#electromagnetic-waves) with extremely high frequency. Gamma rays are one of the rays emitted when atoms decay and break apart. They have the highest energy of the different types of electromagnetic waves but have no charge, therefore gamma rays **do not** deflect in an electric field. 

    Gamma rays are the least ionizing but the most penetrating among the three types of radiations we introduced. Only thick lead can effectively reduce gamma radiation.

Ionizing radiation is extremely harmful to the human body. Long-term excessive accumulation of radioactive elements in the body can cause chronic radiation sickness. Excessive ionizing radiation can cause cancer and teratogenesis.

### Fission

**Nuclear fission**, also known as **fission reaction**, refers to the process in which a heavier (larger mass number) atomic [nucleus](#nucleus) splits into two or more lighter (smaller mass number) atomic nuclei. It is a form of nuclear reaction or radioactive decay. Nuclear fission releases [ionizing radiation](#radiation).

After being hit by **neutrons**, some heavy atomic nuclei will fission into two lighter atoms, releasing several **neutrons** and **photons** in the form of **gamma rays**. The released neutrons will then hit other heavy atomic nuclei, thus forming a **chain reaction**. When a nucleus fissions, in addition to releasing neutrons, it will also release a lot of **heat energy**, which is the source of energy used by nuclear power plants to generate electricity. Therefore, the binding energy of nuclear fission products must be *greater* than the binding energy of reactants. This artificially induced nuclear fission is a type of **artificial nuclear reaction**. Uranium-235, uranium-233, plutonium-239 and other nuclides have a high probability of fissioning after being hit by neutrons, and have the ability to maintain a chain reaction. They are called **fissile materials**. Early atomic bombs were made of plutonium-239 as raw materials, while nuclear power plants mostly use uranium-235 fission as a heat source.

In addition to nuclear fission induced by neutron impact, some heavy atomic nuclei can also spontaneously fission without the need for external factors such as neutrons, which is called **spontaneous fission** and is a form of **radioactive decay**. Spontaneous fission mainly occurs in some nuclides with very high mass numbers, such as curium-250, californium-254, and fermium-256.

Nuclear fission of an element will transform it into another chemical element. The mass of the two atoms formed by fission will be slightly different. For common fissile nuclides, the mass ratio of the two atoms formed is about 3:2.

[Back to catalogue](#catalogue)

### Fusion

**Nuclear fusion**, also known as **fusion reaction**, is a form of nuclear reaction that combines two lighter [nuclei](#nucleus) to form a heavier nucleus and an extremely light nucleus (or particle). In this process, matter is *not* conserved because part of the mass of the fusing nuclei is converted into **energy**. Nuclear fusion is the process that provides energy to [stars](#star).

Atomic nuclei carry a positive [charge](#charge). Therefore, when two atomic nuclei approach each other, they will **repel** each other because they carry the same charge. At this time, they need to be given more energy to make them combine together. When two atomic nuclei with high enough energy meet head-on, the nuclear force will overcome the repulsive electromagnetic force and allow them to combine into new atoms, releasing extremely powerful energy, thus completing the **nuclear fusion reaction**.

Since the distance between nuclei must be *very small* for the nuclear force to work, the nuclei must be aggregated together by **external** energy. Even in the extremely hot and dense center of the sun, each proton has to wait billions of years on average to participate in fusion. In order for fusion to be practical, the utilization rate of atomic nuclei must be greatly improved: the temperature must be raised to $10^{8}$ K, or extremely high pressure must be applied. Controlled nuclear fusion is still difficult to achieve.

## **Space physics**

### Star

A **star** is a **celestial body**, a spherical glowing plasma held together by its own gravity. The **Sun** is the closest star to Earth. The observable universe is estimated to contain between 1022 and 1024 stars, but only about 4,000 are visible to the naked eye. They are all in the **Milky Way**.

Stars undergo [fusion](#fusion) of hydrogen in their cores, which transmit energy from the star's interior outwards over a long path and then radiate from the surface into outer space. Once the nuclear reactions in the core are exhausted, the star's life is about to end. Astronomers determine a star's mass, age, metallicity (abundance of chemical elements), and many other properties by observing its motion in space, brightness, and spectrum. The total **mass** of a star is the main factor in its evolution and ultimate fate.

#### **Life cycle of a star**

Stars are not immortal. Like us, they are born somewhere and will inevitably die, except that stars have much longer lifespans than humans.

- **Protostar**

    There are various substances in the universe, such as gas and dust. They are attractive to each other due to [gravitational force](#weight) and will be pulled together if they are close enough to each other. This forms the protostar, but it is not yet a *star* because the temperature of its center is not high enough for [nuclear fusion](#fusion) to occur. The substances in the protostar keep collapsing and being pulled toward the center.

- **Star**

    The temperature of the center of the protostar increases as its density increases and is soon high enough for **nuclear fusion** to occur. Hydrogen gas in the center of the star transforms into helium. The energy released by the nuclear reaction produces an outward force which cancels out the inward gravitational force. When the two forces are balanced, the **star** is formed. This is also called the **main sequence** of the star.

- **Red giant**

    When the hydrogen fuel in the center of the star begins to run out, the rate of fusion decreases and the expanding force provided by it decreases as well. The star constracts under gravitational force and the center soon becomes hot enough for nuclear fusion of **helium** to occur. This is called a **helium flash**. The helium flash provides an extremely strong expanding force and the star expands into a **red giant**. 

    When the mass of this star is very large (with 8 - 20 times the mass of the Sun), the expanding force provided by the helium flash occurred in it will be strong enough to accelerate substances to a speed that is one tenth of the speed of light. These stars become **supernovas**.

- **White dwarf**

    When all the nuclear fusions are finished, the star conpletely enters its old age and becomes a **white dwarf**. Its mass is still there, therefore it still has internal pressure and temperature. The white light it emitts is not from nuclear reactions, but simply **thermal radiation**.

- **Neutron star**   (Only for massive stars)

    If the mass of the star is so large that the gravitational force is still extremely strong when it has turned into a white dwarf, the structure of [atoms](#atom) will be crushed by gravity. **Electrons** will be crushed into protons and form a neutron as their [charges](#charge) cancells out. Thereby the main substance in the whole celestial body becomes neutrons, forming a **neutron star**.

    However, the state of neutrons are not stable in the neutron star. They will experience [β-decay](#radiation) and turn into a proton, an electron and an antineutrino, therefore reaching a dynamic equilibrium.

    If the mass of the star is so large that even a neutron star cannot resist the tendency of constraction of gravity, it might eventually become a **black hole**.

[Back to catalogue](#catalogue)

### Planet

A **planet** is a spherical, non-luminous object orbiting a [star](#star). Its orbital direction is typically the **same** as the star's rotation (west to east). Generally, a planet must be massive enough to form a **spherical** shape, but it cannot undergo [nuclear fusion](#fusion) reactions like stars. Also, planets must have the ability to clear out smaller bodies from their orbits.

Of the five planets visible to the naked eye in the [solar system](#solar-system), **Mercury**, **Venus**, **Mars**, **Jupiter**, and **Saturn** were discovered long before prehistoric times. After the 16th century, **heliocentrism** replaced **geocentrism**, leading humans to understand that **Earth** itself is a planet. Following the invention of the telescope and the discovery of gravity, **Uranus** and **Neptune** were discovered. In 2006, the International Astronomical Union removed Pluto from the list of planets.

Scientists usually classify planets in the **solar system** based on their properties. There are two main ways to classify them:

**Classification by surface rockiness:**

- **Rocky planets** (also known as **terrestrial planets**)

    Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars, with rocky surfaces.

- **Gas giants**

    Jupiter and Saturn, primarily composed of gas.

- **Ice giants**

    Uranus and Neptune, with thick atmospheres and icy surfaces composed primarily of water, methane, and ammonia.

**Classification by apparent motion:**

(This classification method uses Earth as the boundary, so it necessarily ignores Earth.)

- **Inner planets**

    Planets in the solar system that lie within Earth's orbit, including Mercury and Venus.

- **Outer planets**

    Planets in the solar system that lie outside Earth's orbit, including Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune.

[Back to catalogue](#catalogue)

### Solar system

The **solar system** consists of the **Sun** and the objects orbiting it, bound by its gravity. It formed approximately 4.6 billion years ago. The Sun is a typical [star](#star), maintaining equilibrium through [nuclear fusion](#fusion), fusing hydrogen into helium in its core and releasing this energy in its outer layers.

![Solar system](/images/solar%20system.webp)

Celestial bodies that orbit the Sun are divided into three categories: [planets](#planet), dwarf planets, and small Solar System bodies. Satellites (such as the Moon) do not belong to the small Solar System bodies category because they orbit planets, dwarf planets, or small Solar System bodies rather than the Sun.

The largest celestial bodies orbiting the Sun are the eight planets: the four terrestrial planets (**Mercury**, **Venus**, **Earth**, and **Mars**), the two gas giants (**Jupiter** and **Saturn**), and the two ice giants (**Uranus** and **Neptune**). All terrestrial planets have solid surfaces. In contrast, all giant planets lack defined surfaces, being composed primarily of gas and liquid. Over 99.86% of the solar system's mass is contained in the Sun, with the remaining mass, nearly 90%, contained in Jupiter and Saturn.

#### **Formation of the solar system**

The solar system formed roughly **4.6 billion years ago** through several key stages:  

1. **Collapse of a Molecular Cloud**  
   A giant interstellar cloud of gas and dust (solar nebula), mostly hydrogen and helium, began collapsing under gravity. Scientists consider that a nearby supernova explosion may have triggered this collapse.  

2. **Protostar Formation**  
   The densest region at the center became hotter and more compressed, eventually forming the **protosun** (early Sun). The remaining material flattened into a spinning **protoplanetary disk**.  

3. **Planetesimals and Planetary Embryos**  
   Dust particles in the disk collided and stuck together, growing into kilometer-sized **planetesimals**. These further collided and merged, forming larger **planetary embryos**.  

4. **Planet Formation**  
   - **Terrestrial planets** (Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars) formed close to the Sun, where only rocky and metallic materials could solidify.  
   - **Gas giants** (Jupiter, Saturn) formed farther out, where cold temperatures allowed ice and gas to accumulate, creating massive atmospheres.  
   - **Ice giants** (Uranus, Neptune) formed even farther, incorporating more icy material.  

5. **Clearing the Debris**  
   Once the Sun ignited (entering the **main sequence**), **solar winds** blew away leftover gas. Remaining planetesimals became asteroids (e.g., the **asteroid belt**) or icy bodies (e.g., the **Kuiper Belt**).  

The entire process took about **100 million years**, with Earth forming within **30 million years**.

## **The Origin of Natural Science**

Natural science is the science that studies organic or inorganic things and phenomena in nature. Natural sciences include astronomy, physics, chemistry, environmental science, earth science, biology, medicine, public health, dentistry, pharmacy, atmospheric science, life science, zoology, botany, agriculture, etc.

It is generally believed that the ancient Greeks Thales and Aristotle were the founders of natural science, and Galileo Galilei was the initiator of introducing experiments into natural science. Before the 18th century, natural science and philosophy in Europe were almost inseparable. Philosophers are also natural scientists, as are famous philosophers such as René Descartes, Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, and John Locke. In the early days of the development of natural science, the systematic study of natural objects or classifications was called natural history.

## **Competitions**

As for competitions, we will introduce some physics competitions suitable for junior students who are willing to improve themselves.

### The International Physics Olympiad

The International Physics Olympiad (IPhO) is a physics competition for middle school students, as a kind of international science Olympiad, the International Physics Olympiad is held once a year. The first edition was held in Warsaw, Poland in 1967.

There is one team from each country, consisting of 5 student players and 2 team leaders, and observers can also accompany the team. Students will compete individually to answer theoretical and experimental questions. Students who excel in their performance may receive gold, silver, bronze medals or honorable mentions.

The competition will be held for at least two days and five hours each. The first day consists of three theoretical questions, which must be spread across four areas taught in secondary school (mechanics, thermodynamics, electrodynamics, and quantum mechanics) for a total score of 30 points. The other day is to answer one or two experimental questions with a total score of 20 points. The questions of the competition focused on testing the creativity and understanding of physics rather than the skill and speed of mathematical calculations. There will be at least one day off between the two days. Participants must be secondary school students who have not received tertiary education and are under the age of 21 at the end of the competition. Generally speaking, the team consists of five students, one team leader and one deputy team leader.

Olympiad medals and honours are awarded according to the following rules: Gold medals are awarded to the top 8% of participants. The conditions for the silver medal are the best 25% (minus the gold medalist) of the participants. The conditions for the bronze medal are the best 50% (minus the gold and silver medalists) of the participants. The best 67% (minus the gold, silver and bronze medalists) will receive medals. All participants will receive a badge. The contestant with the highest overall score, the highest female overall score, the highest theoretical paper, and the highest experimental paper will receive a special prize.
