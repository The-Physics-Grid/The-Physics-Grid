# Mechanics

Mechanics (from Ancient Greek: μηχανική, mēkhanikḗ, lit. "of machines") is the area of mathematics and physics concerned with the relationships between force, matter, and motion among physical objects. Forces applied to objects result in displacements or changes of an object's position relative to its environment.

Theoretical expositions of this branch of physics has its origins in Ancient Greece, for instance, in the writings of Aristotle and Archimedes (see History of classical mechanics and Timeline of classical mechanics). During the early modern period, scientists such as Galileo, Kepler, Huygens, and Newton laid the foundation for what is now known as classical mechanics.

As a branch of classical physics, mechanics deals with bodies that are either at rest or are moving with velocities significantly less than the speed of light. It can also be defined as the physical science that deals with the motion of and forces on bodies not in the quantum realm.

- [Kinemetry](https://www.aip.de/en/members/davor-krajnovic/kinemetry/) - Kinemetry analyses 2D maps of the moments of the line-of-sight velocity distribution (LOSVD), such as the mean velocity and the velocity dispersion. The method is a generalisation of surface photometry (e.g. [Jedrzejewski 1987](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1987MNRAS.226..747J/abstract)) to all moments of the LOSVD. It performs harmonic expansion of 2D maps of observed moments (surface brightness, velocity, velocity dispersion, h3, h4...) along the best fitting ellipses (either fixed or free to change along the radii). Its purpose is to robustly quantify maps of the LOSVD moments, describe trends in structures and detect morphological and kinematic sub-components. Kinemetry can also be used for analysis of gas kinematics, in a similar way as classical tilted-ring analysis. This is because kinemetry, in the case of the velocity moment, assumes that motion is along circular orbits within a thin disk. More details about the method can be found in this paper [Krajnović et al. (2006, MNRAS, 366, 787)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2006MNRAS.366..787K/abstract).

  The software was original written in IDL programming language, which you can download from [here](http://www.davor.krajnovic.org/software/). There is also a python version of the code, which is distributed via this [link](https://cloud.aip.de/index.php/s/ctByK9wHgKEWXLy).

In addition, the coupling between airflow and heat transfer and the effect of surface roughness on near wall flow are considered by this program, it can be used for engineering calculation of the friction drag and heat transfer coefficients on airfoil surface.
