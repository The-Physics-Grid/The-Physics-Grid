Particles and vertices are kept separate in a graph structure, physically similar to a physics event. The added information supports the modularisation of event generators. The package has been kept as simple as possible with minimal internal/external dependencies. Event information is accessed by means of iterators supplied with the package.

- [Herwig](https://herwig.hepforge.org/) - Herwig is a multi-purpose particle physics event generator.

  It is built based on the experience gained with both the HERWIG 6 and Herwig++ 2 event generators. Continuing the Herwig++ 2 development, Herwig 7.0 (Herwig++ 3.0) replaces any prior HERWIG or Herwig++ versions.

  Herwig provides significantly improved and extended physics capabilities when compared to both its predecessors, HERWIG 6 and Herwig++ 2, while keeping the key model motivations such as coherent parton showers (including angular-ordered and dipole-based evolution), the cluster hadronization model, an eikonal multiple-interaction model, highly flexible BSM capabilities and improved perturbative input using next-to-leading order QCD.

- [MadFlow](https://github.com/N3PDF/madflow) - MadFlow is a framework for Monte Carlo simulation of particle physics processes designed to take full advantage of hardware accelerators. Processes can be generated using MadGraph5_aMC@NLO and are then output in vectorized (or tensorized) form by the madflow-provided plugin.

  The vectorized output is compiled using the TensorFlow library (hence, tensorized) and then integrated using the VegasFlow library. The PDF interpolation is provided by PDFflow. All tools are capable of running hardware with different hardware acceleration capabilities, such as multi-threading CPU, single-GPU and multi-GPU setups.

- [MadGraph5_aMC@NLO](https://launchpad.net/mg5amcnlo) - MadGraph5_aMC@NLO is a framework that aims at providing all the elements necessary for SM and BSM phenomenology, such as the computations of cross sections, the generation of hard events and their matching with event generators, and the use of a variety of tools relevant to event manipulation and analysis. Processes can be simulated to LO accuracy for any user-defined Lagrangian, an the NLO accuracy in the case of models that support this kind of calculations -- prominent among these are QCD and EW corrections to SM processes. Matrix elements at the tree- and one-loop-level can also be obtained.

  MadGraph5_aMC@NLO is the new version of both MadGraph5 and aMC@NLO that unifies the LO and NLO lines of development of automated tools within the MadGraph family. It therefore supersedes all the MadGraph5 1.5.x versions and all the beta versions of aMC@NLO. As such, the code allows one to simulate processes in virtually all configurations of interest, in particular for hadronic and e+e- colliders; starting from version 3.2.0, the latter include Initial State Radiation and beamstrahlung effects.

You can use it on Linux, macOS, or Windows; it works out of the box.

- [Sherpa](https://sherpa-team.gitlab.io/) - Sherpa is a Monte Carlo event generator for the Simulation of High-Energy Reactions of PArticles in lepton-lepton, lepton-photon, photon-photon, lepton-hadron and hadron-hadron collisions. Simulation programs - also dubbed event generators - like Sherpa are indispensable work horses for current particle physics phenomenology and are (at) the interface between theory and experiment.
- [WHIZARD](https://whizard.hepforge.org/) - WHIZARD is a program system designed for the efficient calculation of multi-particle scattering cross sections and simulated event samples.

  WHIZARD can evaluate NLO QCD corrections in the SM for arbitary lepton and hadron colliders. Tree-level matrix elements are generated automatically for arbitrary partonic processes by using the Optimized Matrix Element Generator O'Mega. Matrix elements obtained by alternative methods (e.g., including loop corrections) may be interfaced as well. The program is able to calculate numerically stable signal and background cross sections and generate unweighted event samples with reasonable efficiency for processes with up to eight final-state particles; more particles are possible. For more particles, there is the option to generate processes as decay cascades including complete spin correlations. Different options for QCD parton showers are available.

## Event Generators

It provides a large (and ever growing) set of experimental analyses useful for MC generator development, validation, and tuning, as well as a convenient infrastructure for adding your own analyses. Rivet is the most widespread way by which analysis code from the LHC and other high-energy collider experiments is preserved for comparison to and development of future theory models. It is used by phenomenologists, MC generator developers, and experimentalists on the LHC and other facilities.
- [SModelS](https://smodels.github.io/) - SModelS is based on a general procedure to decompose Beyond the Standard Model (BSM) collider signatures presenting a Z2 symmetry into Simplified Model Spectrum (SMS) topologies. Our method provides a way to cast BSM predictions for the LHC in a model independent framework, which can be directly confronted with the relevant experimental constraints.

The framework is interfaced to standard file formats (e.g. Les Houches Event File or HepMC) and outputs observables such as isolated leptons, missing transverse energy and collection of jets which can be used for dedicated analyses. The simulation of the detector response takes into account the effect of magnetic field, the granularity of the calorimeters and sub-detector resolutions. Visualisation of the final state particles is also built-in using the corresponding ROOT library.
- [MadAnalysis](https://launchpad.net/madanalysis5) - MadAnalysis 5 is a framework for phenomenological investigations at particle colliders. Based on a C++ kernel, this program allows to efficiently perform, in a straightforward and user-friendly fashion, sophisticated physics analyses of event files such as those generated by a large class of Monte Carlo event generators.

- [GAMBIT](https://gambit.hepforge.org/) - GAMBIT is a global fitting code for generic Beyond the Standard Model theories, designed to allow fast and easy definition of new models, observables, likelihoods, scanners and backend physics codes.

- [HiggsBounds](https://gitlab.com/higgsbounds/higgsbounds) - HiggsBounds takes a selection of Higgs sector predictions for any particular
  model as input and then uses the experimental topological cross section limits
  from Higgs searches at LEP, the Tevatron and the LHC to determine if this
  parameter point has been excluded at 95% C.L..

- [HiggsSignals](https://gitlab.com/higgsbounds/higgssignals) - HiggsSignals performs a statistical test of the Higgs sector predictions of arbitrary models (using the HiggsBounds input routines) with the measurements of Higgs boson signal rates and masses from the Tevatron and the LHC.

- [GFitter](http://project-gfitter.web.cern.ch/project-gfitter/) - The generic fitting package Gfitter comprises a framework for the statistical analysis of parameter estimation problems in HEP. It is specifically designed to provide a user-friendly environment for involved fitting problems, such as the global Standard Model fit to electroweak precision data. During its development, it was found that Gfitter is also a convenient framework for averaging problems, ranging from simple weighted means using or not correlated input data, to more involved problems with common systematic errors, requiring or not parameter rescaling.

- [Contur](https://hepcedar.gitlab.io/contur-webpage/) - The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is probing physics in a new kinematic region, at energies around and above the electroweak symmetry-breaking scale. With the discovery of the Higgs boson [38, 147], ATLAS and CMS demonstrated that the understanding of electroweak symmetry-breaking within the Standard Model (SM) is broadly correct, and thus that the theory is potentially valid well above the TeV scale. Many precision measurements have been published, reaching into this new kinematic domain.

- [xFitter (former HERAFitter)](https://www.xfitter.org/) - Proton parton distribution functions (PDFs) are essential for precision physics at the LHC and other hadron colliders. The determination of the PDFs is a complex endeavor involving several physics process. The main process is the lepton proton deep-inelastic scattering (DIS), with data collected by the HERA ep collider covering a large kinematic phase space needed to extract PDFs. Further processes (fixed target DIS, ppbar collisions etc.) provide additional constraining powers for flavour separation. In particular, the precise measurements obtained or to come from LHC will continue to improve the knowledge of the PDF.

  The xFitter project is an open source QCD fit framework ready to extract PDFs and assess the impact of new data. The framework includes modules allowing for a various theoretical and methodological options, capable to fit a large number of relevant data sets from HERA, Tevatron and LHC. This framework is already used in many analyses at the LHC.

A precise knowledge of the so-called Parton Distribution Functions (PDFs) of the proton, which describe their structure in terms of their quark and gluon constituents, is a crucial ingredient of the physics program of the Large Hadron Collider of CERN.

- [LHAPDF](https://lhapdf.hepforge.org/) - LHAPDF is the standard tool for evaluating parton distribution functions (PDFs) in high-energy physics. PDFs encode the flavour and momentum structure of composite particles, such as protons, pions and nuclei; most cross-section calculations are based on parton-level matrix-elements which must be connected to the real interacting particles, hence PDFs are an essential ingredient of phenomenological and experimental studies at hadron and heavy-ion colliders (e.g. LHC, HERA, Tevatron, EIC, FCC) and in cosmic-ray physics.

  PDFs themselves are fitted to a range of data by various collaborations. LHAPDF provides the definitive community library of such fits, in a standard data-format, as well as C++ and Python interfaces for evaluating them. Written as a general purpose C++ interpolator for estimating PDFs from discretised data files, it has also found more general uses, such as for fragmentation functions (essentially the inverse of PDFs).

- [Spheno](https://spheno.hepforge.org/) - SPheno stands for S(upersymmetric) Pheno(menology). The code calculates the SUSY spectrum using low energy data and a user supplied high scale model as input.

In addition the production cross sections for supersymmetric particle and Higgs bosons in e^+ e^- annihilation is calculated. Moreover, the branching of the decay $b \to s \gamma$, the SUSY contribution to anomalous magnetic moment of the muon as well as the SUSY contributions to the rho parameter due to sfermions are calculated. The code is written in F90 with an emphasis on easy generalisability. The structure is set such that complex phases as well as the extension to include the flavour structure can be done in a straight forward way. The 2-loop renormalization group equations as well as the one-loop finite corrections a la Bagger, Matchev, Pierce and Zhang are included.

Also exports some related formats like .coo, .cfg and .xyz-files. The program has been published in Computer Physics Communications 182 (2011) 1183–1186. Please cite generously.

- [SARAH](https://sarah.hepforge.org/) - SARAH is a Mathematica package for building and analyzing SUSY and non-SUSY models.

SARAH writes model files for FeynArts, CalcHep/CompHep, which can also be used for dark matter studies using MicrOmegas, the UFO format which is supported by MadGraph 5 and for WHIZARD and OMEGA.  
  SARAH was also the first available spectrum-generator-generator: based on derived analytical expressions it creates source code for SPheno. It is therefore possible to implement new models in SPheno without the need to write any Fortran code by hand. The output for Vevacious can be used to check for the global minimum for a given model and parameter point.  
  Running SARAH is fast, it already includes a long list of SUSY and non-SUSY models, and the implementation of new models is efficient and straightforward.

- [Sym2int](https://renatofonseca.net/sym2int) - Extensions of the Standard Model (SM) might involve a different gauge group and/or new fields; in either case, it is important to understand what is the most general Lagrangian invariant under the symmetries of the model. However, sometimes one might forget to write down some valid interactions, and/or even end up writing some interactions which do not exist. Automatizing the process might help to reduce such mistakes.

  This page describes the Mathematica code Sym2Int (Symmetries to Interactions) which lists all valid interactions given the model's gauge group and fields (specified by their gauge and Lorentz representations). The program is valid for renormalizable interactions (mass dimension ≤4
  ) as well as the ones which are not renormalizable (mass dimension >4
  ). Since version 2, terms with derivatives and gauge bosons are also accounted for. More details can be found below.

## Susyno

- [Susyno](https://renatofonseca.net/susyno) is a Mathematica package which calculates the 2-loop renormalisation group equations of generic supersymmetric models, based on any gauge group (the only exception being multiple U(1) groups) and with any field content.

## Effective Field Theories

- [DsixTools](https://dsixtools.github.io/) - DsixTools is a Mathematica package for the handling of the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) and the Low-energy Effective Field Theory (LEFT) with operators up to dimension six, both at the algebraic and numerical level.

- [smelli](https://smelli.github.io/) - smelli is a Python package providing a global likelihood function in the space of dimension-six Wilson coefficients in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). The likelihood includes contributions from quark and lepton flavour physics, electroweak precision tests, and other precision observables.

  The package is based on flavio for the calculation of observables and statistical treatment and wilson for the running, translation, and matching of Wilson coefficients.

## Feyn Family

- [FeynRules](https://feynrules.irmp.ucl.ac.be/) - FeynRules is a Mathematica® package that allows the calculation of Feynman rules in momentum space for any QFT physics model. The user needs to provide FeynRules with the minimal information required to describe the new model, contained in the so-called model-file. This information is then used to calculate the set of Feynman rules associated with the Lagrangian. The Feynman rules calculated by the code can then be used to implement the new physics model into other existing tools, such as MC generators. This is done via a set of interfaces which are developed together and maintained by the corresponding MC authors.

- [FeynArts](http://www.feynarts.de/) - FeynArts is a Mathematica package for the generation and visualization of Feynman diagrams and amplitudes.

- [LoopTools](http://www.feynarts.de/looptools/) - LoopTools is a package for evaluation of scalar and tensor one-loop integrals based on the [FF package by G.J. van Oldenborgh](http://gjvo.home.xs4all.nl/FF.html). It features an easy Fortran, C++, and Mathematica interface to the scalar one-loop functions of FF and in addition provides the 2-, 3-, and 4-point tensor coefficient functions.

## Statistics

- [pyhf](https://github.com/scikit-hep/pyhf) - The HistFactory p.d.f. template [[CERN-OPEN-2012-016](https://cds.cern.ch/record/1456844)] is per-se independent of its implementation in ROOT and sometimes, it’s useful to be able to run statistical analysis outside of ROOT, RooFit, RooStats framework.

  This repo is a pure-python implementation of that statistical model for multi-bin histogram-based analysis and its interval estimation is based on the asymptotic formulas of “Asymptotic formulae for likelihood-based tests of new physics” [[arXiv:1007.1727](https://arxiv.org/abs/1007.1727)]. The aim is also to support modern computational graph libraries such as PyTorch and TensorFlow in order to make use of features such as autodifferentiation and GPU acceleration.

- [blueice](https://github.com/JelleAalbers/blueice) - This package allows you to do parametric inference using likelihood functions, in particular likelihoods derived from Monte-Carlo or calibration sources.

  Especially when connected to a Monte Carlo, blueice lets you make likelihood functions which measure agreement between data and theory with flexibility: you choose which settings to vary (which parameters the likelihood functions has) and in which space the agreement is measured.

  This package contains only generic code: you'll need a few things to make it useful for a particular experiment. Originally this code was developed for XENON1T only; the XENON1T models have since been split off to the [laidbax](https://github.com/XENON1T/laidbax) repository.
