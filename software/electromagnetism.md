# Electromagnetism

In physics, electromagnetism is an interaction that occurs between particles with electric charge via electromagnetic fields. The electromagnetic force is one of the four fundamental forces of nature. It is the dominant force in the interactions of atoms and molecules. Electromagnetism can be thought of as a combination of electrostatics and magnetism, two distinct but closely intertwined phenomena. Electromagnetic forces occur between any two charged particles, causing an attraction between particles with opposite charges and repulsion between particles with the same charge, while magnetism is an interaction that occurs exclusively between charged particles in relative motion. These two effects combine to create electromagnetic fields in the vicinity of charge particles, which can accelerate other charged particles via the Lorentz force. At high energy, the weak force and electromagnetic force are unified as a single electroweak force.

Here are some of the projects that are related to electromagnetism.

- [2DMED](https://sourceforge.net/projects/twodmed/) - 2DMED it is the second out of two programs which allows implementation of Phase Sensitive Detection (PSD) and/or Modulated Enhanced Diffraction (MED) techniques on the in situ data. This software takes normalized and averaged in situ data in flat file format (FLT) and performs PSD transformation which has been described in Urakawa, A.et al. Chem. Eng. Science 2008, 63, 4902. User can choose demodulation index k and perform several demodulation calculations. This is extremely important since demodulation calculations at k = 2 on in situ powder diffraction data represent implementation of MED method which been described in Chernyshov, D. et al. Acta Cryst. 2011, A67, 327. Demodulated data can be then viewed on 2D and/or 1D plot and analyses with different tools including In Phase Plot, Maximum Amplitude Plot and Positive Pattern Plot. Demodulated data also can be saved in ASCII format for further analysis.

- [ARDP -- Antenna Radiation Diagram Plotter](https://sourceforge.net/projects/ardp/) - Antenna Radiation Diagram Plotter - Polar plots of measured EM emission, with a proper radial axis scaling and span.

- [Arbitrary Transmission Line Calculator](https://sourceforge.net/projects/atlc/) - 'atlc' is a CAD package used for analysing and desiging electrical transmission lines of arbitrary cross section. Also for the design of directonal couplers. Some parts are CPU intensive, so multiple CPUs are supported.

DIM uses to create distributed DAQ and experiment control systems. DIMTree is browser for DIM which provides Tree View to browse DIM Servers, his published Services and it's data content. It's useful test/monitor/debug tool for DIM users.

- [Elk](https://elk.sourceforge.io/) - An all-electron full-potential linearised augmented-planewave (FP-LAPW) code. Designed to be as developer friendly as possible so that new developments in the field of density functional theory (DFT) can be added quickly and reliably.

- [GridLAB-D](https://sourceforge.net/projects/gridlab-d/) - GridLAB-D is a new power system simulation tool that provides valuable information to users who design and operate electric power transmission and distribution systems, and to utilities that wish to take advantage of the latest smart grid technology. It incorporates advanced modeling techniques with high-performance algorithms to deliver the latest in end-use load modeling technology integrated with three-phase unbalanced power flow, and retail market systems. Historically, the inability to effectively model and evaluate smart grid technologies has been a barrier to adoption; GridLAB-D is designed to address this problem.

- [Hex - Hydrogen-Electron Collisions](https://sourceforge.net/projects/hecs/) - A computer code for simulation of electron-hydrogen scattering. Contains three (more or less) finished sub-programs:

  (a) “hex-ecs” which solves the Schrödinger equation in the B-spline basis,

  (b) “hex-dwba” which computes scattering variables for high energies using the distorted wave Born approximation of the first order and finally

  (c) “hex-db” which is a user interface to a plain SQLite database, where the intermediate results are being stored, and which is used to extract derived quantities like a cross section from it.

  Several more solvers are being developed right now - namely the second order of Born approximation for use in Born subtraction and the intermediate energy regime, and the relativistic variant of ECS for solution of (n,l,j,m,σ) ⟶ (n',l',j',m',σ') transitions.

- [Jljp](https://sourceforge.net/projects/jljp/) - **Calculates the voltage across a liquid junction between two solutions** Liquid junction potential calculator. It's a tool for scientists and engineers who have to do with electrochemistry and electrokinetics. When two solutions containing ions are put into contact, possibly through a porous diaphragm, a voltage develops across them. The calculation of the voltage is not trivial. The program is written in Java. Includes classes that can be included in other programs, together with graphical interfaces (also as an applet).

  An analogous project written in C# can be found here: https://github.com/swharden/JLJP

- [MaxFEM](https://sourceforge.net/projects/maxfem/) - MaxFem is an open software package for electromagnetic simulation by using finite element methods. The package can solve problems in electrostatics, direct current, magnetostatics and eddy-currents.

This makes it useful for quantum optics experiments, in particular as a digital feedback controller for analog systems. Based on the open source software provided by the board manufacturer, PyRPL (Python RedPitaya Lockbox) implements many devices that are needed for optics experiments with the Red Pitaya. PyRPL implements various digital signal processing (DSP) modules (see features below). It allows to arbitrarily interconnect the available DSP modules and retrieve signal values on timescales below 1 ms. The graphical user interface (GUI) provides a realtime display of the various measurement instruments and allows the easy configuration of DSP signal chains and feedback controllers. At the highest abstraction level, arbitrary feedback sequences can be defined to fulfill tasks as complex as approaching and locking a resonance of a high-finesse Fabry-Perot cavity (tested up to finesse=100,000).
