## Mechanical Waves

- [Acoustic Research Tool (ART)](https://sourceforge.net/projects/artool/) - ART is a flexible simulation framework for wind instruments. It includes a growing library of modelling elements. So far bore discontinuities, branches, tone holes, cylindrical and conical tubes, Bessel horns and bent tubes are available for frequency domain modelling.

  In the time domain generic bidirectional propagation elements, scattering elements, fractional delays, convolution with reflection functions and general z-domain networks are available and can be described using MuParserX expressions. Cylindrical and conical ducts can also be defined based on their geometry.

  Available models and their parameters can be enumerated and combined to form simulators for complex acoustical structures. Parameters can be specified symbolically by expressions containing other parameter values or global variables.

  Dependencies between parameters are resolved at run time. However, MuParserX expressions are compiled at design time. Zero-delay loops are detected and reported.

- [AnalyzeNNLS](https://sourceforge.net/projects/analyzennls/) - Users load multiecho MRI data and draw ROIs. AnalyzeNNLS creates a T2 distribution from the averaged decay data. Regional fractions and geometric T2 times can be determined. Please reference: Bjarnason TA, Mitchell JR. JMR 206:200-4 (2010).

- [cphcttoolbox](https://pypi.org/project/cphcttoolbox/) - Copenhagen Computed Tomography Toolbox is a collection of applications and libraries for flexible and efficient CT reconstruction. The toolbox apps generally take a set of projections (X-ray intensity measurements) and filter and back project them in order to recreate the image or volume that the projections represent. The project includes both mostly informative CPU implementations and highly efficient GPU implementations.

- [IF97](https://sourceforge.net/projects/if97/) - Steam tables for industrial use according to the international standard for the properties of water and steam, the IAPWS-IF97 formulation and the international standards for transport and other properties.

  Hummeling Engineering BV develops engineering software in the fields of thermodynamics, mechanics, hydrodynamics, and digital signal processing.

- [Inelastica](https://github.com/tfrederiksen/inelastica) - Inelastica is both the name of this whole Python package as well as that of an included script to compute inelastic transport characteristics. Inelastica is based on the SIESTA/TranSIESTA DFT codes.

  The project was initiated around 2003-2005 by Thomas Frederiksen and Magnus Paulsson while they worked in the group of Mads Brandbyge at the Technical University of Denmark.

- [iTides](https://sourceforge.net/projects/itides/) - With the support of the NSF and ONR over the past few years we have developed a MATLAB tool that calculates the internal wave field generated by barotropic tidal flow of a nonlinearly stratified fluid past any arbitrary two-dimensional topography of finite extent.
- [pyrocko](https://github.com/pyrocko/pyrocko) - A seismology toolkit for Python
- [SasView](https://www.sasview.org/) - SasView is a Small Angle Scattering (SAS) analysis package for the analysis of 1D and 2D scattering data directly in inverse space. The focus was originally on neutron data (SANS) but has been used for X-rayâ€™s as well and includes a tool for determining a slit resolution for the SAXSess instrument. SansView also includes PrView to invert SAS data to P(r), a resolution calculator, and a scattering length density calculator among others tools. A simple plugin mechanism is available for users to add custom models.

  This project was initiated by the NSF funded DANSE project, DMR-0520547, SANS sub-project at the University of Tennessee Knoxville. Acknowledgement of that original funding would be appreciated in any publications that make use of the software.

- [sw4](https://github.com/geodynamics/sw4) - 3-D seismic modeling
- [Virtual Reflectometer](https://sourceforge.net/projects/virtualreflectometer/) - With Virtual Reflectometer (VR), you can simulate the basic alignment scans of a basic X ray reflectometer (diffractometer) with a Goebel mirror using ray tracing.
  With this program, you can characterize reflectometers and get a reflectometer-dependent overillumination correction for X Ray Reflectivity (XRR) scans.
  The pogram serves as an educational tool for explaining alignment and for a proper overillumination correction of XRR data.

- [water_hammer_simulation](https://sourceforge.net/projects/water-hammer-simulation/) - With differents numerical methods this application simulate the water hammer phenomenon.

  - Use differents numerical methods.
  - Can see animation!
  - Export results as tables.

- [webgl-ripples](https://github.com/m-ender/webgl-ripples) - A physically realistic real-time simulation of (transversal) 2D waves in

- [wxProdOp](https://sourceforge.net/projects/wxprodop/) - The program does nmr product operator calculations for one, two, three and four spins. Receiver phase cycling is possible in conjunction with pulse phase cycling to simulate coherence pathway selection. An extensive manual and help files are included. Currently running under Linux and Windows.

- [xdesktopwaves](https://sourceforge.net/projects/xdesktopwaves/) - Simulation of water waves on the X Windows desktop. Windows and mouse are like ships on the sea. Each movement of these ends up in moving water waves. You can even have rain and/or storm stirring up the water.
