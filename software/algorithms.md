Some algorithms related to physics

- [Ani3D](https://sourceforge.net/projects/ani3d/) - Ani3D provides portable libraries for each step in the numerical solution of systems of PDEs with variable tensorial coefficients: (1) unstructured adaptive mesh generation, (2) metric-based mesh adaptation, (3) finite element discretization and interpolation, (4) algebraic solvers.

- [Construct2D](https://sourceforge.net/projects/construct2d/) - Construct2D is a grid generator designed to create 2D grids for CFD computations on airfoils. The grids are generated in Plot3D format. The only required input file is the set of coordinates defining the airfoil geometry, using the same format as XFoil, the popular vortex-panel code for airfoil analysis. Construct2D can create grids with O topology (recommended for airfoils with a blunt trailing edge) or C topology (recommended for airfoils with a sharp trailing edge). Now available in version 2.0: hyperbolic grid generation to create higher quality grids in a fraction of the time compared to elliptic grid generation. Elliptic grid generation is still available also. Smooth airfoil surface spacing is handled automatically with user-controlled clustering parameters. Also included is a visualizer written in Python with matplotlib.

- [F3DM](https://sourceforge.net/projects/f3dm/) - f3dmlib is a FEM library that can read, write and analyse 3D tetrahedral meshes, minimize a given functional, and refine the resulting meshes. The minimization is parallelized with OpenMP.

- [GXSM](https://gxsm.sourceforge.net/) - GXSM -- Gnome X Scanning Microscopy: A multi-channel image and vector-probe data acquisition and visualization system designed for SPM techniques (STM,AFM..), but also SPA-LEED/LEED/LEEM data analysis. A plug-in interface allows any user add-on data-processing and special hardware and instrument support. Latest: NC-AFM and related explorative methods as SQDM can be configured. High-Speed external PAC-PLL hardware option with digital DSP link.

  Based on several hardware options it supports a commercially available DSP hardware and provided also Open Source Code for all the low level signal processing tasks and instrument controls in a most flexible and adaptable manner.

- [Matrix Product State (MPS) Simulations]()
- [Open Source MPS (OSMPS)](https://sourceforge.net/projects/openmps/) - Open Source MPS (OSMPS) is a collection of numerical routines for performing tensor network algorithms to simulate entangled, 1D many-body quantum systems. Our applications reach from ground state and excited states for statics to the dynamics of time-dependent Hamiltonians. We offer various time evolution methods with an emphasis on the support of long-range interactions through the matrix product state formalism. For more algorithms, see the list of features below.
- [QSAS](https://sourceforge.net/projects/qsas/) - Analysis and display software targeted at space physics data.
- [Quantities](https://sourceforge.net/projects/quantity/) - Quantities provides an interface to the use of numbers which are associated with a dimension and a unit (physical quantities) in computer calculations (quantity calculus) just like C++ built-in types.
- [SPIRE](https://sourceforge.net/projects/spire-tool/) - A tool to compute projections of membrane structures
- [TMVA](https://root.cern/) - TMVA is a ROOT-integrated toolkit for multivariate classification and regression analysis. TMVA performs the training, testing and performance evaluation of a large variety of multivariate methods.Since 2013, TMVA has been fully integrated with ROOT and is distributed as part of it.
