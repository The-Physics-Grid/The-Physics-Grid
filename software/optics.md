# Optics

Optics is the branch of physics that studies the behaviour and properties of light, including its interactions with matter and the construction of instruments that use or detect it.[1] Optics usually describes the behaviour of visible, ultraviolet, and infrared light. Because light is an electromagnetic wave, other forms of electromagnetic radiation such as X-rays, microwaves, and radio waves exhibit similar properties.[1]

Most optical phenomena can be accounted for by using the classical electromagnetic description of light, however complete electromagnetic descriptions of light are often difficult to apply in practice. Practical optics is usually done using simplified models. The most common of these, geometric optics, treats light as a collection of rays that travel in straight lines and bend when they pass through or reflect from surfaces. Physical optics is a more comprehensive model of light, which includes wave effects such as diffraction and interference that cannot be accounted for in geometric optics. Historically, the ray-based model of light was developed first, followed by the wave model of light. Progress in electromagnetic theory in the 19th century led to the discovery that light waves were in fact electromagnetic radiation.

Some phenomena depend on light having both wave-like and particle-like properties. Explanation of these effects requires quantum mechanics. When considering light's particle-like properties, the light is modelled as a collection of particles called "photons". Quantum optics deals with the application of quantum mechanics to optical systems.

Optical science is relevant to and studied in many related disciplines including astronomy, various engineering fields, photography, and medicine (particularly ophthalmology and optometry, in which it is called physiological optics). Practical applications of optics are found in a variety of technologies and everyday objects, including mirrors, lenses, telescopes, microscopes, lasers, and fibre optics.

Here are some of the most popular optics software:

- [AR65view](https://ar65view.sourceforge.net/) - The Java-Programm ar65view.jar is intended to analyse and manipulate the photoemission data measured by the ARPES experiments AR65 and WESPHOA. Both are part of the workgroup EES by Prof. Manzke at the Department of Physics, Humboldt University to Berlin, Germany. The program is written in Java 1.5 and runs therefore under Windows as well as Linux and Mac OS

- [GenX](https://aglavic.github.io/genx/) - GenX is a versatile program using the differential evolution algorithm for fitting, primarily, X-ray and neutron reflectivity data, lately also surface x-ray diffraction data. The differential evolution algorithm is a robust optimization method which avoids local minima but at same is a highly effective. GenX is written in python and uses the wxpython package for the Graphical User Interface (GUI) Screenshot. A model to fit is defined either through a GUI plug-in or via a python script. The possibility to script everything makes it easy to develop completely new fitting models. Clearly, GenX is extremely modular, making it possible to extend the program with models and plug-ins for most fitting problems. At the present GenX is shipped with models for x-ray and neutron specular reflectivity, off-specular x-ray reflectivity and surface x-ray diffraction.

- [radlab](https://sourceforge.net/projects/radlab/) - Radiation detection and measurement education is necessary for a wide variety of people working with radiation. The equipment and laboratory setup needed for delivering this education are expensive and difficult to assemble due to the large variety of the type of experiments that are desirable to cover. For a basic education one needs to have gamma, beta, alpha and neutron sources, at least one detector to detect each type of radiation and other supplemental instrumentation to perform experiments. Although the radiation exposure due to these radioactive sources in an education laboratory is low, shielding and a private secured place is needed. Nearly two hundred thousand dollars is needed to construct such a basic laboratory described as above. In order to overcome these difficulties, a model of a basic Radiation Detection Laboratory has been created to provide a virtual environment for designing and simulating such experiments.

Of that way any waveguide geometry can be handled. Several plots are available : refractive index plot, field propagation plot and modes spectrum plot. This permits, with the interpretation of the guided and radiation modes spectrum, a physical understanding of the propagation mechanisms in the integrated optical device under evaluation. The complex geometry of the component is discretized in a stack of multilayer dielectric waveguides.
