- [nuCopter](https://www.hep.anl.gov/cosmology/Pert/README.html)

  1. We have modified the background cosmology class in Copter (J.Carlson, M. White and N. Padmanabhan, Phys. Rev. D80, 043531, 2009) to include the equation of state parameterization w(a) = w_0 + w_a(1-a) of M. Chevalier and D. Polarski, Int. J. Mod. Phys. D 10, 213 (2001), and E.V. Linder, Phys. Rev. Lett. 90, 091301 (2003). Resulting modifications to the growth are automatically included. This change applies to all of the perturbation theories covered by Copter.

  2. For Time-RG only, we have modified the Copter evolution equations to include neutrinos as a source for the growth of nonlinear CDM and baryon perturbations. This works by interpolating the transfer functions output by CAMB using a parameter file such as the one in our example. The method was described in M. Pietroni, JCAP 0810 (2008) 036, and J. Lesgourgues, et al., JCAP 0906 (2009) 017. The figure below shows our results for an early dark energy model with massive neutrinos.

  3. Our modified Copter requires omega_b = Omega_b h^2, omega_c, and omega_nu be provided as inputs, along with w0, wa, and the usual Copter inputs h, n, and Tcmb. Note that nonzero omega_nu with perturbation theories other than Time-RG is not supported.

- [velocileptors](https://github.com/sfschen/velocileptors) - Velocity-based perturbation theory (both Lagrangian (LPT) and Eulerian (EPT) formulations) expansions of redshift-space distortions and velocity statistics.

  This code computes the real- and redshift-space power spectra and correlation functions of biased tracers using 1-loop perturbation theory (with effective field theory counter terms and up to cubic biasing) as well as the real-space pairwise velocity moments.

## Black hole perturbation theory

- [BHPT - Black Hole Perturbation Toolkit](http://bhptoolkit.org/) - The Black Hole Perturbation Toolkit brings together software and data relating to black hole perturbation theory. These can then be used to model gravitational radiation from small mass-ratio binaries as well as from the ringdown of black holes. The former are key sources for the future space-based gravitational wave detector, [LISA](https://www.lisamission.org/).

  Our overall goal is for less researcher time to be spent writing code and more time spent doing physics. Currently there exist multiple scattered black hole perturbation theory codes developed by a wide array of individuals or groups over a number of decades. This project aims to bring together some of the core elements of these codes into a Toolkit that can be used by all.

  The BHPToolkit is it made up of many different tools which can be individually installed by users depending on what they are interested in. The [Toolkit and Data repository](http://bhptoolkit.org/toolkit.html) page lists the currently available software and data and on the page for each tool you will find its installation instructions.

## Cosmic Rays

- [CORSIKA](https://www.iap.kit.edu/corsika/) - CORSIKA (COsmic Ray SImulations for KAscade) is a program for detailed simulation of extensive air showers initiated by high energy cosmic ray particles. Protons, light nuclei up to iron, photons, and many other particles may be treated as primaries.

  The particles are tracked through the atmosphere until they undergo reactions with the air nuclei or - in the case of instable secondaries - decay. The hadronic interactions at high energies may be described by several reaction models alternatively:The VENUS, QGSJET, and DPMJET models are based on the Gribov-Regge theory, while SIBYLL is a minijet model. The neXus model extends far above a simple combination of QGSJET and VENUS routines. The most recent EPOS model is based on the neXus framework but with important improvements concerning hard interactions and nuclear and high-density effect. HDPM is inspired by findings of the Dual Parton Model and tries to reproduce relevant kinematical distributions being measured at colliders.

- [CRPropa](https://crpropa.desy.de/) - CRPropa is a publicly available simulation framework to study the propagation of ultra-high-energy nuclei up to iron on their voyage through an (extra)galactic environment. It takes into account: pion production, photodisintegration and energy losses by pair production of all relevant isotopes in the ambient low-energy photon fields as well as nuclear decay. CRPropa can model the deflection in (inter)galactic magnetic fields, the propagation of secondary electromagnetic cascades and neutrinos for a multitude of scenarios for different source distributions and magnetic environments. It enables the user to predict the spectra of UHECR (and of their secondaries), their composition and arrival direction distribution. Additionally, the low-energy Galactic propagation can be simulated by solving the transport equation using stochastic differential equations. CRPropa features a very flexible simulation setup with python steering and shared-memory parallelization.

- [Dragon](https://github.com/cosmicrays) - DRAGON adopts a second-order Cranck-Nicholson scheme with Operator Splitting and time overrelaxation to solve the diffusion equation. This provides fast a solution that is enough accurate for the average user. Occasionally, users may want to have very accurate solutions to their problem. To enable this feature, users may get close to the accurate solution by using the fast method, and then switch to a more accurate solution scheme, featuring the Alternating-Direction-Implicit (ADI) Cranck-Nicholson scheme.

  Some parts of DRAGON are built following GALPROP, v50p. The first reason is that it is a waste of time to reimplement standard parts, like energy losses, in which nothing new has to be found. The second reason is that it is essential to be able to compare our predictions with that of the Galprop code, and this can be done only by following the details of its implementation. Therefore, we kept in the code some features and models used in Galprop, like nuclear cross-sections, the gas distribution, the convergence technique. However, each of these models is accompanied by other models, which can be selected by setting the appropriate switch. This is done very easily using the well known C++ structure of abstract/derived classes. The code is then very flexible and easy to manage and to modify or update.

- [GALPROP](https://galprop.stanford.edu/) - GALPROP is a numerical code for calculating the propagation of relativistic charged particles and the diffuse emissions produced during their propagation. The GALPROP code incorporates as much realistic astrophysical input as possible together with latest theoretical developments.

Each run of the code is governed by a configuration file allowing the user to specify and control many details of the calculation. Thus, each run of the code corresponds to a potentially different ``model''. The code itself continues to be developed and is available to the scientific community via this website.

- [PICARD](https://astro-staff.uibk.ac.at/~kissmrbu/Picard.html) - Picard is a Galactic cosmic ray propagatio code developed at Innsbruck University.

The code can be run on essentially all supercomputer systems presently in use, including clusters of workstations or individual PCs.

  GADGET computes gravitational forces with a hierarchical tree algorithm (optionally in combination with a particle-mesh scheme for long-range gravitational forces) and represents fluids by means of smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH). The code can be used for studies of isolated systems, or for simulations that include the cosmological expansion of space, both with or without periodic boundary conditions. In all these types of simulations, GADGET follows the evolution of a self-gravitating collisionless N-body system, and allows gas dynamics to be optionally included. Both the force computation and the time stepping of GADGET are fully adaptive, with a dynamic range which is, in principle, unlimited.

  GADGET can therefore be used to address a wide array of astrophysically interesting problems, ranging from colliding and merging galaxies, to the formation of large-scale structure in the Universe. With the inclusion of additional physical processes such as radiative cooling and heating, GADGET can also be used to study the dynamics of the gaseous intergalactic medium, or to address star formation and its regulation by feedback processes.

The Poisson equation for self-gravity of the gas and dark matter is solved using geometric multigrid method. The approach to AMR in Nyx uses a nested hierarchy of logically-rectangular grids with simultaneous refinement of the grids in both space and time. The integration algorithm on the grid hierarchy is a recursive procedure in which coarse grids are advanced in time, fine grids are advanced multiple steps to reach the same time as the coarse grids and the data at different levels are then synchronized. A separate synchronization is done for gravity.

## Stellar Modelling

- [ESTER (Evolution STEllaire en Rotation)](http://ester-project.github.io/ester/) - The ambition of this project is to set out a two-dimensional stellar evolution code, which fully takes into account the effects of rotation, at any rate and in a self-consistent way.

  The difficult, but important point is that rotating stars are spheroidal and are never in hydrostatic equilibrium. They are pervaded by flows everywhere, even in the stably stratified radiative regions. These flows are essentially convective flows in thermally unstable regions (convection zones) and baroclinic flows in the radiative regions. These latter flows are grosso modo a differential rotation and a meridional circulation, with likely some small-scale turbulence. Radiative regions of non-rotating stars experience very little mixing (only due to microscopic phenomena). Rotation induces flows and therefore some mixing, well-known as "rotational mixing". This is a key feature of the evolution of rotating stars. Besides, these stars also oscillate, and astronomers would like to get from the oscillation frequencies some good constraints on the structure of these stars. The foregoing reasons and many others motivated us to construct a two-dimensional model of rotating stars that is kind enough to enlight us on the numerous questions we are wondering about...

- [GYRE](https://github.com/rhdtownsend/gyre) - GYRE is a stellar oscillation code. Given an input stellar model, GYRE calculates the eigenfrequencies and eigenfunctions for the normal oscillation modes of the model. These data can be put to a variety of uses; the most common is to compare them against observed oscillation frequencies of a star, allowing constraints on the star's fundamental parameters (mass, radius, etc.) to be established — the discipline of asteroseismology.

- [MESA](https://docs.mesastar.org/en/release-r22.11.1/) - MESA was primarily developed through the concerted efforts of Bill Paxton over a 10 year period with the engagement and deep involvement of many theoretical and computational astrophysicists.

We therefore consider it important to re-express the guiding principles for using and contributing to MESA. Our goal is to assure the greatest usefulness for the largest number of research and educational projects.
