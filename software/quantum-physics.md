- [artiq](https://github.com/m-labs/artiq) - Next-generation control system for quantum information experiments
- [C++QED](https://sourceforge.net/projects/cppqed/) - C++QED is an application-programming framework for simulating open quantum dynamics in general. It has demonstrated the ability to simulate full Master equation of up to several thousand, and quantum trajectories of up to several hundred thousand dimensions.

  The basic idea is to allow users to build arbitrarily complex interacting quantum systems out of free subsystems and interactions (elements), and simulate their time evolution with a number of available time-evolution drivers.

  C++QEDv2 specifies a small grammar to describe composite quantum systems. Apart from providing a number of elements out of the box, there are tools which facilitate the implementation of new elements. These are being added continuously, as the need arises.

  The principal concept of the design of C++QEDv2 is that all information available at compile time should be processed as such, with the help of TMP. The framework is very sensitive to performance both in computer resources and coding/design.

- [jQuantum](https://sourceforge.net/projects/jquantum/) - jQuantum is a Java program to simulate a quantum computer, to design quantum circuits, and to visualize the execution of quantum algorithms. Another main purpose, however, is to create images in your head, and thereby - understanding.

- [Kwant](https://kwant-project.org/) - Kwant is a free (open source) Python package for numerical calculations on tight-binding models with a strong focus on quantum transport. It is designed to be flexible and easy to use. Thanks to the use of innovative algorithms, Kwant is often faster than other available codes, even those entirely written in the low level FORTRAN and C/C++ languages.

  It is adapted (by the same authors) from code that was originally supplied on a CD with the first edition of the book [1] and is now made available under the GPL3 license. In brief, we encourage everyone to use the software in your studies and research, to study and modify the source-code and to share it widely. However, you are not permitted to include any of our code in a closed-source project.

- [RSchr-5](https://sourceforge.net/projects/rschr-5/) - RSchr-5 calculates the smallest eigenvalues of the one-electron Schrödinger equation.The solved problem is defined on the finite domain, which is a box. The problem is solved with the zero Dirichlet boundary conditions.The implemented algorithm uses Finite Element Method with B-splines as basis functions. Disctretization leads to generalized eigenvalue problem.Program RSchr-5 solves the generalized eigenvalue problem by algorithms implemented in SLEPc amd PETSc libraries. It uses Krylov-Schur algorithm from SLEPc library.The program is implemented in C++.The implementation is based on Message Passing Interface (MPI).

- [WavePacket](https://sourceforge.net/projects/matlab.wavepacket.p/) - WavePacket is a program package for numerical simulation of quantum-mechanical wavepacket dynamics of distinguishable particles. It can be used to solve single or coupled time-independent or time-dependent (linear) Schrödinger and Liouville-von Neumann-equations, partly also classical or quantum-classical Liouville equations. Optionally accounting for the interaction with external electric fields within the semiclassical dipole approximation, WavePacket can be used to simulate modern experiments involving ultrashort light pulses in photo-induced physics or chemistry, including quantum optimal control. Allowing for visualization of dynamics 'on the fly', WavePacket is easy to use .
