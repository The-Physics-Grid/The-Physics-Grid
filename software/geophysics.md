# Geophysics

Geophysics (/ˌdʒiːoʊˈfɪzɪks/) is a subject of natural science concerned with the physical processes and physical properties of the Earth and its surrounding space environment, and the use of quantitative methods for their analysis. Geophysicists, who usually study geophysics, physics, or one of the earth sciences at the graduate level, complete investigations across a wide range of scientific disciplines. The term geophysics classically refers to solid earth applications: Earth's shape; its gravitational, magnetic fields, and electromagnetic fields ; its internal structure and composition; its dynamics and their surface expression in plate tectonics, the generation of magmas, volcanism and rock formation.However, modern geophysics organizations and pure scientists use a broader definition that includes the water cycle including snow and ice; fluid dynamics of the oceans and the atmosphere; electricity and magnetism in the ionosphere and magnetosphere and solar-terrestrial physics; and analogous problems associated with the Moon and other planets.

Here are some of the software packages that are used in geophysics:

- [AGLAEMap](https://sourceforge.net/projects/aglaemap/) - Programs for visualization, handling and quantification of PIXE maps at the AGLAE facility

- [burnman](https://github.com/geodynamics/burnman) - a library for modeling mantle thermodynamics and thermoelasticity constrained by mineral physics experiments
- [em](https://github.com/geoscixyz/em) - Electromagnetic methods in geophysics - open educational resources
- [GPLib++](https://sourceforge.net/projects/gplib/) - Geophysical Library is a C++-library to handle geophysical data. At the moment the focus is on magnetotelluric and seismic data. It also includes a genetic algorithm for data inversion, signal processing and statistics routines.

- [Madagascar](https://www.reproducibility.org/) - Madagascar is a software package for geophysical data processing and reproducible numerical experiments. The package mission is to provide a convenient environment for researchers working with digital image and data processing in geophysics and related fields. [[Github](https://github.com/ahay/src)]

- [openGPR](https://sourceforge.net/projects/opengpr/) - openGPR is a framework for the management, processing and 2D/3D-visualization of ground penetrating radar (GPR, georadar) data. It interoperates with existing tools like Seismic Unix, with a special focus on georadar applications.

- [simpeg](https://github.com/simpeg/simpeg) - Simulation and Parameter Estimation in Geophysics - A python package for simulation and gradient based parameter estimation in the context of geophysical applications
