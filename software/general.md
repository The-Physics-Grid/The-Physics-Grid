  In addition to built-in FEM and PDE solvers, FEATool features full integration with the high performance OpenFOAM CFD and FEniCS PDE solvers. With built-in CAD and pre-processing, automatic mesh generation, solvers, and postprocessing, FEATool enables large scale dynamical models and physics simulations to be set up and solved easily and quickly directly in the FEATool MATLAB GUI. Multiphysics and multi-simulation also allows for fully coupled fluid flow, heat transfer, chemical transport, electromagnetics, and fluid-structure interaction simulations.

- [FisicaLab](https://www.gnu.org/software/fisicalab/) - FisicaLab (can be pronounced as PhysicsLab) is an educational application to solve physics problems. Its main objective is let the user to focus in physics concepts, leaving aside the mathematical details (FisicaLab take care of them). This allows the user to become familiar with the physical concepts without running the risk of getting lost in mathematical details. And so, when the user gain confidence in applying physical concepts, will be better prepared to solve the problems by hand (with pen and paper). The latest release of FisicaLab have the following modules:

  - Kinematics of points 2D.
  - Circular kinematics of points 2D.
  - Static of points 2D.
  - Static of rigid bodies 2D.
  - Dynamics of points 2D.

  It can display a variety of calculation results including support for most major molecular file formats. The advanced "Molecule Builder" allows to rapidly sketch in molecules and examine them in 3D. Graphics can be exported to various formats, including animations.

- [Interactive Physics](https://www.physicscurriculum.com/interactivephysics) - Interactive Physics is a versatile program that allows users to build a wide variety of physics simulations. The robust interface allows the user to build simple or elaborate systems on screen. Build systems made up of ropes, rods, pulleys, gears, springs, various joints, actuators, dampers, motors, and objects of various shape and mass.

- [Newton](https://newtonlab.com/English/newton/) - Newton provides a completely new way of learning and teaching physics, the exploration of simple machines, mechanisms, kinematics, dynamics, thermodynamics, electricity and optics on a computer in 3D. Build, manipulate or investigate real-life 3D physics experiments interactively, solve problems, and more.

  A unique feature of Newton is that while it shows real world 3D physical experiments, it is still possible to compare and verify the results with classic formulas. This allows students to establish a clear connection between the real world and its mathematical models, and develops their model creating skills. Another novelty of Newton is the possibility of coupled modeling of mechanics electricity and optics.

- [oPhysics](https://ophysics.com/) - The oPhysics website is a collection of interactive physics simulations. It is a work in progress, and likely always will be. Content will be added as time allows.

- [pyPENELOPE](https://pypenelope.sourceforge.net/) - pyPENELOPE is an open-source software to facilitate the use of the Monte Carlo code PENELOPE and its main program PENEPMA in the field of microanalysis. It consists in a graphical user interface (GUI) to setup materials, geometry, simulation parameters and position of the detectors as well as to display the simulationâ€™s results. An application programming interface (API) is also available to create a large series of simulations using object-oriented programming and to interpret efficiently the results from these simulations.

- [REDUCE](https://reduce-algebra.sourceforge.io/) - REDUCE is a portable general-purpose computer algebra system. It is a system for doing scalar, vector and matrix algebra by computer, which also supports arbitrary precision numerical approximation and interfaces to gnuplot to provide graphics. It can be used interactively for simple calculations (as illustrated in the screenshot below) but also provides a full programming language, with a syntax similar to other modern programming languages. REDUCE supports alternative user interfaces including Run-REDUCE, TeXmacs and GNU Emacs.
