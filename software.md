- [Kinemetry](https://www.aip.de/en/members/davor-krajnovic/kinemetry/) - Kinemetry analyses 2D maps of the moments of the line-of-sight velocity distribution (LOSVD), such as the mean velocity and the velocity dispersion. The method is a generalisation of surface photometry (e.g. [Jedrzejewski 1987](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1987MNRAS.226..747J/abstract)) to all moments of the LOSVD. It performs harmonic expansion of 2D maps of observed moments (surface brightness, velocity, velocity dispersion, h3, h4...) along the best fitting ellipses (either fixed or free to change along the radii). Its purpose is to robustly quantify maps of the LOSVD moments, describe trends in structures and detect morphological and kinematic sub-components. Kinemetry can also be used for analysis of gas kinematics, in a similar way as classical tilted-ring analysis. This is because kinemetry, in the case of the velocity moment, assumes that motion is along circular orbits within a thin disk. More details about the method can be found in this paper [Krajnović et al. (2006, MNRAS, 366, 787)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2006MNRAS.366..787K/abstract).

### Big Bang Nucleosynthesis

- [ACROPOLIS](https://acropolis.hepforge.org/) - ACROPOLIS is a generic framework to calculate the evolution of the light-element abundances due to photodisintegration reactions induced by different BSM particles. With ACROPOLIS, the widely discussed cases of decays as well as annihilations can be run without prior coding knowledge within example programs. However, its modular structure also makes it possible to easily implement other BSM physics scenarios.
- [AlterBBN](https://alterbbn.hepforge.org/) - AlterBBN is a C program which computes the abundances of the elements predicted by Big-Bang nucleosynthesis (BBN). Different cosmological scenarios are implemented in AlterBBN, which can alter the BBN predictions. Also, AlterBBN is included in the SuperIso Relic package so that the alternative models can be tested using BBN constraints.
- [PArthENoPE](https://parthenope.na.infn.it/) - PArthENoPE is a FORTRAN77 numerical code which computes the abundances of light nuclides produced during Big Bang Nucleosynthesis. Starting from nuclear statistical equilibrium conditions the program solves the set of corresponding coupled ordinary differential equations, follows the departure from chemical equilibrium of nuclear species, and determines their asymptotic abundances as function of several input cosmological parameters as the baryon density, the number of effective neutrino species, the value of cosmological constant and the neutrino chemical potential.

  Horndeski is the most general scalar-tensor theory described by second-order equations of motion, and contains many well known models, including (but by no means limited to) covariant Galileons, Brans-Dicke, f(R), chameleons, k-essence and quintesssence. hi_class relies on a reformulation of the Effective Field Theory for Dark Energy developed by E. Bellini and I. Sawicki (see JCAP 1407 (2014) 050).

This is based on code by Daniel Eisenstein, implementing the algorithm of Philcox et al. 2021, and uses their conventions. This currently features support for the isotropic 2PCF, 3PCF, 4PCF, 5PCF and 6PCF, with the option to subtract the Gaussian 4PCF contributions at the estimator level. For the 4PCF, 5PCF and 6PCF algorithms, the runtime is dominated by sorting the spherical harmonics into bins, which has complexity O(N_galaxy x N_bins^3 x N_ell^5) [4PCF], O(N_galaxy x N_bins^4 x N_ell^8) [5PCF] or O(N_galaxy x N_bins^5 x N_ell^11) [6PCF].

- [Aquarius](https://wwwmpa.mpa-garching.mpg.de/aquarius/) - The Aquarius Project is a large-scale collaborative programme of the Virgo Consortium, similar in scope and scale to the Millennium Simulation project. At present, the principal set of Aquarius simulations contains six examples of an isolated halo similar in mass to that of the Milky Way. These are simulated in their full cosmological context (assuming the concordance LCDM cosmology) and at various resolutions up to about 200 million particles (counted within the radius where the enclosed density is 200 times the cosmic mean). One halo is also simulated at even higher resolution, resulting in almost 1.5 billion particles within this radius. These simulations are being used to understand the fine-scale structure predicted around the Milky Way by the standard structure formation model, and as the basis for simulation by various techniques of the growth of the stellar components of our Galaxy.

To this end, we have simulated a cubic box 200 h-1 Mpc with different resolutions and physics, ranging from 5123 to 20483 particles. These simulations of the whole box have been used to identify the objects of interest in order to generate the initial conditions for the resimulations. We made use of a new Initial Conditions Generation code called GINNUNGAGAP written by Steffen Knollmann at UAM. This code has some new features such as variable domain decompositions (slab or pencil) for the Fast Fourier Transform in 3D, fully parallel random number generator and the realizations of random gaussian fluctuations in real space, rather than in Fourier space. Increasing levels of mass refinements can easily be generated in this way to almost unlimited number, provided that there are sufficiente computational MPI nodes. Thanks to the pencil domain decomposition, there is no limitation in the mesh sizes used to compute the density fields and to FFT them.

  To tackle this broad range of questions, we make use of a variety of data sets from COSMOS, BOSS, the Stripe 82 co-adds, and IFU observations from the MaNGA survey.

  The Massive Galaxy Project includes the following results and data-products:

  The Stripe 82 Massive Galaxy Catalog (S82-MGC), including a mass limited sample of 41,770 galaxies with log Mstar/Msun>11.2 to z=0.7

### Extended Cosmologies

- [pyLDT-cosmo](https://github.com/mcataneo/pyLDT-cosmo) - A Python package to generate matter PDF predictions in Large Deviation Theory for ΛCDM and alternative cosmologies.

  pyLDT-cosmo is partly based on the Julia programming language, which uses a Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler to improve runtime performance. However, this feature comes at the expense of slow library loading when compared to pure or pre-compiled Python packages. On a modern computer pyLDT-cosmo takes about 80 seconds to load. After that computation is very efficient, taking only ~3 seconds to derive the matter PDF's simultaneuosly for all models, redshifts and smoothing radii.

- [nuCopter](https://www.hep.anl.gov/cosmology/Pert/README.html)

  1. We have modified the background cosmology class in Copter (J.Carlson, M. White and N. Padmanabhan, Phys. Rev. D80, 043531, 2009) to include the equation of state parameterization w(a) = w_0 + w_a(1-a) of M. Chevalier and D. Polarski, Int. J. Mod. Phys. D 10, 213 (2001), and E.V. Linder, Phys. Rev. Lett. 90, 091301 (2003). Resulting modifications to the growth are automatically included. This change applies to all of the perturbation theories covered by Copter.

  2. For Time-RG only, we have modified the Copter evolution equations to include neutrinos as a source for the growth of nonlinear CDM and baryon perturbations. This works by interpolating the transfer functions output by CAMB using a parameter file such as the one in our example. The method was described in M. Pietroni, JCAP 0810 (2008) 036, and J. Lesgourgues, et al., JCAP 0906 (2009) 017. The figure below shows our results for an early dark energy model with massive neutrinos.

  3. Our modified Copter requires omega_b = Omega_b h^2, omega_c, and omega_nu be provided as inputs, along with w0, wa, and the usual Copter inputs h, n, and Tcmb. Note that nonzero omega_nu with perturbation theories other than Time-RG is not supported.

### Black hole perturbation theory

- [BHPT - Black Hole Perturbation Toolkit](http://bhptoolkit.org/) - The Black Hole Perturbation Toolkit brings together software and data relating to black hole perturbation theory. These can then be used to model gravitational radiation from small mass-ratio binaries as well as from the ringdown of black holes.

  Our overall goal is for less researcher time to be spent writing code and more time spent doing physics. Currently there exist multiple scattered black hole perturbation theory codes developed by a wide array of individuals or groups over a number of decades. This project aims to bring together some of the core elements of these codes into a Toolkit that can be used by all.

  The BHPToolkit is it made up of many different tools which can be individually installed by users depending on what they are interested in.

### Cosmic Rays

- [CORSIKA](https://www.iap.kit.edu/corsika/) - CORSIKA (COsmic Ray SImulations for KAscade) is a program for detailed simulation of extensive air showers initiated by high energy cosmic ray particles. Protons, light nuclei up to iron, photons, and many other particles may be treated as primaries.

  The particles are tracked through the atmosphere until they undergo reactions with the air nuclei or - in the case of instable secondaries - decay. The hadronic interactions at high energies may be described by several reaction models alternatively:The VENUS, QGSJET, and DPMJET models are based on the Gribov-Regge theory, while SIBYLL is a minijet model. The neXus model extends far above a simple combination of QGSJET and VENUS routines. The most recent EPOS model is based on the neXus framework but with important improvements concerning hard interactions and nuclear and high-density effect. HDPM is inspired by findings of the Dual Parton Model and tries to reproduce relevant kinematical distributions being measured at colliders.

- [CRPropa](https://crpropa.desy.de/) - CRPropa is a publicly available simulation framework to study the propagation of ultra-high-energy nuclei up to iron on their voyage through an (extra)galactic environment.

CRPropa can model the deflection in (inter)galactic magnetic fields, the propagation of secondary electromagnetic cascades and neutrinos for a multitude of scenarios for different source distributions and magnetic environments. It enables the user to predict the spectra of UHECR (and of their secondaries), their composition and arrival direction distribution. Additionally, the low-energy Galactic propagation can be simulated by solving the transport equation using stochastic differential equations. CRPropa features a very flexible simulation setup with python steering and shared-memory parallelization.

  ![CRPropa](/images/pscan-home.png)

- [Dragon](https://github.com/cosmicrays) - DRAGON adopts a second-order Cranck-Nicholson scheme with Operator Splitting and time overrelaxation to solve the diffusion equation. This provides fast a solution that is enough accurate for the average user. Occasionally, users may want to have very accurate solutions to their problem. To enable this feature, users may get close to the accurate solution by using the fast method, and then switch to a more accurate solution scheme, featuring the Alternating-Direction-Implicit (ADI) Cranck-Nicholson scheme.

  Some parts of DRAGON are built following GALPROP, v50p. The first reason is that it is a waste of time to reimplement standard parts, like energy losses, in which nothing new has to be found. The second reason is that it is essential to be able to compare our predictions with that of the Galprop code, and this can be done only by following the details of its implementation. Therefore, we kept in the code some features and models used in Galprop, like nuclear cross-sections, the gas distribution, the convergence technique. However, each of these models is accompanied by other models, which can be selected by setting the appropriate switch. This is done very easily using the well known C++ structure of abstract/derived classes. The code is then very flexible and easy to manage and to modify or update.

The code can be run on essentially all supercomputer systems presently in use, including clusters of workstations or individual PCs.

  GADGET computes gravitational forces with a hierarchical tree algorithm (optionally in combination with a particle-mesh scheme for long-range gravitational forces) and represents fluids by means of smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH). The code can be used for studies of isolated systems, or for simulations that include the cosmological expansion of space, both with or without periodic boundary conditions. In all these types of simulations, GADGET follows the evolution of a self-gravitating collisionless N-body system, and allows gas dynamics to be optionally included. Both the force computation and the time stepping of GADGET are fully adaptive, with a dynamic range which is, in principle, unlimited.

  GADGET can therefore be used to address a wide array of astrophysically interesting problems, ranging from colliding and merging galaxies, to the formation of large-scale structure in the Universe. With the inclusion of additional physical processes such as radiative cooling and heating, GADGET can also be used to study the dynamics of the gaseous intergalactic medium, or to address star formation and its regulation by feedback processes.

### Stellar Modelling

- [ESTER (Evolution STEllaire en Rotation)](http://ester-project.github.io/ester/) - The ambition of this project is to set out a two-dimensional stellar evolution code, which fully takes into account the effects of rotation, at any rate and in a self-consistent way.

  The difficult, but important point is that rotating stars are spheroidal and are never in hydrostatic equilibrium. They are pervaded by flows everywhere, even in the stably stratified radiative regions. These flows are essentially convective flows in thermally unstable regions (convection zones) and baroclinic flows in the radiative regions. These latter flows are grosso modo a differential rotation and a meridional circulation, with likely some small-scale turbulence. Radiative regions of non-rotating stars experience very little mixing (only due to microscopic phenomena). Rotation induces flows and therefore some mixing, well-known as "rotational mixing". This is a key feature of the evolution of rotating stars. Besides, these stars also oscillate, and astronomers would like to get from the oscillation frequencies some good constraints on the structure of these stars. The foregoing reasons and many others motivated us to construct a two-dimensional model of rotating stars that is kind enough to enlight us on the numerous questions we are wondering about...

- [GYRE](https://github.com/rhdtownsend/gyre) - GYRE is a stellar oscillation code. Given an input stellar model, GYRE calculates the eigenfrequencies and eigenfunctions for the normal oscillation modes of the model.

We therefore consider it important to re-express the guiding principles for using and contributing to MESA. Our goal is to assure the greatest usefulness for the largest number of research and educational projects.

The program is able to calculate numerically stable signal and background cross sections and generate unweighted event samples with reasonable efficiency for processes with up to eight final-state particles; more particles are possible. For more particles, there is the option to generate processes as decay cascades including complete spin correlations. Different options for QCD parton showers are available.

It is specifically designed to provide a user-friendly environment for involved fitting problems, such as the global Standard Model fit to electroweak precision data. During its development, it was found that Gfitter is also a convenient framework for averaging problems, ranging from simple weighted means using or not correlated input data, to more involved problems with common systematic errors, requiring or not parameter rescaling.

- [Contur](https://hepcedar.gitlab.io/contur-webpage/) - The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is probing physics in a new kinematic region, at energies around and above the electroweak symmetry-breaking scale. With the discovery of the Higgs boson [38, 147], ATLAS and CMS demonstrated that the understanding of electroweak symmetry-breaking within the Standard Model (SM) is broadly correct, and thus that the theory is potentially valid well above the TeV scale. Many precision measurements have been published, reaching into this new kinematic domain.

- [xFitter (former HERAFitter)](https://www.xfitter.org/) - Proton parton distribution functions (PDFs) are essential for precision physics at the LHC and other hadron colliders. The determination of the PDFs is a complex endeavor involving several physics process. The main process is the lepton proton deep-inelastic scattering (DIS), with data collected by the HERA ep collider covering a large kinematic phase space needed to extract PDFs. Further processes (fixed target DIS, ppbar collisions etc.) provide additional constraining powers for flavour separation. In particular, the precise measurements obtained or to come from LHC will continue to improve the knowledge of the PDF.

  The xFitter project is an open source QCD fit framework ready to extract PDFs and assess the impact of new data. The framework includes modules allowing for a various theoretical and methodological options, capable to fit a large number of relevant data sets from HERA, Tevatron and LHC.

- [LHAPDF](https://lhapdf.hepforge.org/) - LHAPDF is the standard tool for evaluating parton distribution functions (PDFs) in high-energy physics. PDFs encode the flavour and momentum structure of composite particles, such as protons, pions and nuclei; most cross-section calculations are based on parton-level matrix-elements which must be connected to the real interacting particles, hence PDFs are an essential ingredient of phenomenological and experimental studies at hadron and heavy-ion colliders (e.g. LHC, HERA, Tevatron, EIC, FCC) and in cosmic-ray physics.

  PDFs themselves are fitted to a range of data by various collaborations. LHAPDF provides the definitive community library of such fits, in a standard data-format, as well as C++ and Python interfaces for evaluating them. Written as a general purpose C++ interpolator for estimating PDFs from discretised data files, it has also found more general uses, such as for fragmentation functions (essentially the inverse of PDFs).

  SARAH was also the first available spectrum-generator-generator: based on derived analytical expressions it creates source code for SPheno. It is therefore possible to implement new models in SPheno without the need to write any Fortran code by hand. The output for Vevacious can be used to check for the global minimum for a given model and parameter point.  
  Running SARAH is fast, it already includes a long list of SUSY and non-SUSY models, and the implementation of new models is efficient and straightforward.

- [Sym2int](https://renatofonseca.net/sym2int) - Extensions of the Standard Model (SM) might involve a different gauge group and/or new fields; in either case, it is important to understand what is the most general Lagrangian invariant under the symmetries of the model. However, sometimes one might forget to write down some valid interactions, and/or even end up writing some interactions which do not exist. Automatizing the process might help to reduce such mistakes.

  This page describes the Mathematica code Sym2Int (Symmetries to Interactions) which lists all valid interactions given the model's gauge group and fields (specified by their gauge and Lorentz representations). The program is valid for renormalizable interactions (mass dimension ≤4
  ) as well as the ones which are not renormalizable (mass dimension >4
  ). Since version 2, terms with derivatives and gauge bosons are also accounted for. More details can be found below.

- [blueice](https://github.com/JelleAalbers/blueice) - This package allows you to do parametric inference using likelihood functions, in particular likelihoods derived from Monte-Carlo or calibration sources.

  Especially when connected to a Monte Carlo, blueice lets you make likelihood functions which measure agreement between data and theory with flexibility: you choose which settings to vary (which parameters the likelihood functions has) and in which space the agreement is measured.

  This package contains only generic code: you'll need a few things to make it useful for a particular experiment. Originally this code was developed for XENON1T only; the XENON1T models have since been split off to the [laidbax](https://github.com/XENON1T/laidbax) repository.
