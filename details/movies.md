# Movies, Documentaries and video channels

The 'Physics Movies' section is a collection of movies , videos and documentaries about physics studies and lives of the great physicists. This section helps us better understand physics through the objective authenticity of documentaries.

Here are some well-known Youtube video channels on physics:

- [Advanced Physics](https://www.youtube.com/@AdvancedPhysics) - I'm Dr. Rajendra Prasad (Professor in Physics, LS College Muzaffarpur). I've started this channel to provide the concept of graduation and post-graduation level physics in a simple and concise way. These videos will help you in preparation for various competitive examinations like IIT-JAM, NET, JEST, and admission tests in renowned institutions of India for the study of higher physics. If you find these videos helpful please share it with your friend who might do so too.

- [Andy Masley's IB Physics Lectures](https://www.youtube.com/@AndyMasley) - 我教授 IB 物理，並就每個 IB 物理 SL 主題進行視頻講座。我使用這些視頻代替課堂上的現場講座，因此對於初次學習該材料的高中學生來說，它們是可以訪問和理解的。在每個視頻中，我的目標都是最大程度的清晰度，以及僅是理解 IB 物理課程所需的詳細程度。我在該頻道的播放列表中有按 IB 主題組織的講座。我的所有講座也都是按照 IB 主題在我的網站上組織的：andymasley.com/lecture-videos/

- [DrPhysicsA](https://www.youtube.com/@DrPhysicsA) - This YouTube channel contains a series of Physics videos which are intended to give a basic introduction to the subjects covered. They explain the essence of the subject in as simple as way as possible. They assume basic knowledge of algebra and calculus and some general physics.

  UK A levels are broadly equivalent to USA AP/ SATs. UK GCSEs are broadly equivalent to US high school diploma.

  Dr PhysicsA has a BSc (physics) and PhD (nuclear physics) from King's College, London.

The 8.01x and 8.02x edX lectures are high resolution (480p) versions of the more commonly seen OCW versions. Some edits were also made by Lewin. 8.03 is the OCW version, also in a 480p resolution. Links to lecture notes, assignments/solutions and exams/solutions are added. Playlists with Help Sessions for 8.01x, 8.02x and 8.03 are also available. They are "mini lectures". The problems discussed in these videos should be apparent after watching the first few minutes. Other playlists show Lewin in various appearances and his Bi-Weekly Physics problems/solutions and several excellent lectures by Feynman and others.
